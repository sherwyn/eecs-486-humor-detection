I was very much looking forward to going to Modern on Melrose as my sister had raved about the selection and several purchases she recently made here. I was all set to help her select more furniture for her new home until I experienced a combination of disbelief, shock and horror. \n\nI was inside the store when I heard a man loudly say \"If you're going to start a sale, finish it!\" It took a few more seconds of loud voices before I realized an argument was taking place between two employees and not two customers, as I initially thought. The male and female employee continued to loudly argue, back and forth. Feeling very uncomfortable, I started to look for my sister. There were about four other customers and we all ended up outside as we all felt very uncomfortable in the store. \n\nAs I was walking out of the store to go out back, I heard the male employee say, in a tone that was beyond anger but instead violent, \"Don't you ever tell me to shut up! Ever!\" Shortly after, he walked past all 5 female customers, who had gathered out back, turned to us and angrily said \"Bitch!\" Not knowing what he was going to do when he returned, we decided to leave as we did not feel safe. \n\nIt is one thing to feel uncomfortable, it is completely unacceptable to not feel safe. The interaction between the two employees was the most unprofessional thing I have ever witnessed. The male and female employee were so caught up in their own negative interaction, neither of them offered any customer service. And after their argument ended, the female employee offered no apologies and still no customer service. \n\nToday was my first and last time in Modern on Melrose. How terribly sad for this store. I sincerely hope the owners get a handle on this and educate their employees as to what it and isn't acceptable behavior.", "business_id": "2LfIuF3_sX6uwe-IR-P0jQ", "stars": 1, "date": "2013-11-17", "useful": 4, "type": "review", "cool": 2}, {"funny": 5, "user_id": "B7ecAeAIrXg7sgmabS38pg", "review_id": "RAzbLYbgw3tNv8Tu0R7qmQ", "text": "Hmmm, what to say about Mint.\n\nOkay, if you are a girl and looking for clothes here, I'd say pass.

Ended up backtracking through Brecksville and I remembered an old friend. London Pickle Works! Was it still there some four years after I stopped in while house shopping? Yup. Incidentally, investing in a condo down there probably would have made more sense than buying a house in Lakewood. Live and learn.\n\nCozied up to the bar and ordered a Killians, plus cheesesteak to go(for pooch). Like the Unicorn, food was amazingly done before I could chug my brew. I could get used to this kind of service. The bar was all old men. Matt, I don't know how you do it. They were watching Fox news for chrissakes!! Total was eight dollars! Holy shit. I dropped a three dollar tip on that barmaid's ass. How could I not? A real meal at fast food prices, at fast food speed, served by someone not under house arrest with work privileges. Busted open the styro box. Big sandwich with mushrooms, onions, cheez and beef sliced so thin I swear it was a Steak'um. I never ate those as a kid, but I remember one time my friend had one in his bedroom where we were playing NES. He didn't want it, so we threw it all around the room. Fries were awesome. Also got a pickle. That's eight dollars with the beer, just to recap. Great value, nice location, old men.

Am I missing some sort of cultural significance here? \n\nThe place is dark with small tables, chairs and booths.  It took them ten minutes to hand us the menus after being seated which I thought was incredibly appalling because I'm sure they didn't forget about us.  They have candles on the tables which made it kinda uncomfortable because it seemed too romantic for our own goods (We were hungry and randomly walked into this place).  I ain't gonna lie, the food was good!  We ordered some noodles which tasted like mixed flavors of Chinese and Italian.  Surprise, surprise, it came in a tiny portion that can easily be confused as an appetizer.  WTF mang.  There were just too many selections on the menu (sarcasm) so I ordered an eye roll.  For more than a dub, it's not worth it.  But compared to other rolls I've had at other sushi places, this roll melted in my mouth with just the right amount of flavor, MmmM.

I enjoy watching the Sunday night football game here and enjoying a drink or two.  Last night I decided to grab a bite to eat.\n\nI was dining by myself and wanted some finger food.  After browsing the menu for a few minutes, I decided to go with the Nachos ($10.50).  To wash it down, I had an Iced Tea.\n\nI watched the Giants/Bears game while I waited for my grub......it didn't take too long before it came....the waitress delivered the Nachos and they were a friggin' mountain of Nachos!  (see pics) Seriously.....I'm not opposed to large portions, but damn this thing could easily feed 4 people!  I was a little pissed because I didn't want to eat that much and the waitress didn't say anything.....also the menu didn't mention the gargantuan size of the Nachos either.  I reacted by saying \"Damn, that's a friggin' mountain of food!\".....she replied \"I know\"......well if you knew, why didn't you say something when I ordered it?!\n\nThis is where I am torn....do I knock off a Star because of this?  or not?  I personally feel that it's the server's responsibility to inform customers of stuff like this....especially when they see someone is dining alone and portion size is not mentioned on the menu.\n\nBack to the food....the Nachos were topped with melted Cheddar Cheese, Jalapenos, Guacamole, Sour Cream, Onions, Olives, Tomatoes.  The thing was so massive that stuff was falling off the edges of plate....another faux pas from the server is that she didn't offer me a smaller plate to eat my Nachos.....she expected me to pull pieces off this mountain and have it fall all over the table like a pig.  I tried for a few minutes but felt like a slob so I asked her for a plate, which she brought over right away.\n\nThe Nachos flavor wasn't spectacular, it was bleh.  The Cheese wasn't gooey....it was melted, but seemed to be sitting a little while because it was already coagulating and it was difficult to eat the Nachos without using a fork.  Also, it was top heavy with the toppings....meaning after the 1st layer of Nachos, there was nothing but bare chips in the lower sections.  What's the point of this dish then?  I don't know.....I felt bad because I didn't even come close to finishing it and it wasn't worth taking home......what a waste of food.\n\nI took off 1 Star because of the bad service.....still a great place to catch a game.  I've eaten here many times in the past with great experiences, but was an inactive Yelper at the time so those experiences are outdated.\n\nWill I return?  Because of my favorable history with Big Dog's, I will give them another chance.....next time I'm asking the server how large the portion is.", "business_id": "1Lbq92b6B9z1FYk5mS2R9Q", "stars": 2, "date": "2010-10-04", "useful": 10, "type": "review", "cool": 6}, {"funny": 4, "user_id": "pMefTWo6gMdx8WhYSA2u3w", "review_id": "EiiK6ayw26wEOb3bF8scqw", "text": "Seeing as there are reviews for Dine on L3 (Yorkdale mall) and Urban Eatery (Eaton Centre), I figure I would review the new food court in Square One which is going by the name of \"Food Central\".

I came here because my dearest friend told me to so I did!  I had snooped on their website and blog the week before so I knew I *had* to try the Ferrero cookie on top of some other goods.  Between the two of us, we had a cookie, a lemon bar that was recommended by the friendly barista with the cool hair, a macchiato, and an iced tea.  \n\nThe first sip of the espresso sent me straight onto Cloud 9.  It was rich, fragrant, and creamy.  It made Addiction stir and I was hooked by that vixen.  Girl, I will never give you up again.  The iced tea helped clean the palate as well as that super tasty and tart lemon bar.  Could this be fresh lemon juice?  If it was concentrate, it fooled me.  As for the Ferrero cookie, it was everything I imagined it would be and more.  It was crispy on the edges and soft and delicious in the middle.  Nutella and a very generous amount of hazelnuts decorated the top.  It got a tad too sweet with the ample amount of hazelnut spread but I imagine it being perfect with a foamy latte.  I wish they drew a tiny leaf in my espresso...\n\nThe coffee shop itself is very hipster industrial chic --- wood, steal, a bike, a marquee arrow, a mattress sans the cover and fluff, and glass bottles as lighting. It was very cool.  I like the concrete floors and all the reclaimed wood.  I could imagine a young Joyce sitting here with all her other art student friends, the WP Carey business majors working on their stuffy group assignments on the leather couch and arm chairs, and the regular Tempe resident grabbing a cuppa before work.

Apparently, these were being tested for an upcoming breakfast offering.\n\nI liked the cold brew tasting-- four cold brews of your choosing, for $6.  You then get to choose a 12 oz. pour of cold brew, or opt for any pastry/dessert from the case.  I chose Ethiopian, Apple Jack, Blackberry-Lavender, and Coconut.  Funny how the two I thought I'd enjoy the most (the last two) would be my least favorites!  I'd definitely order the Ethiopian cold brew again, and perhaps the Apple Jack with cream.  The blackberry-lavender was too tart, and I could only detect the berry, which was unfortunate, since I love lavender-scented anything: chocolates/truffles, ice creams/gelatos, shortbreads, soaps, and lotions, etc.  The house-made tiramisu was just OK.  Actually, I didn't eat much of it at the time, since I already had enough milk fat and sugar from the salted creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e coffee here, and I ended up throwing away the leftovers at home that night, since most of the takeaway cup was filled with waxy cream filling.

Leather chairs and sofas make for comfy private lounges for the lucky (or wealthy) few who occupy them. The sprawling patio is an excellent place on a late summer evening in Arizona. Multiple bars make for relatively speedy service. And the overall gargantuan size of the place makes the crowd seem less, well, crowded.\n\nBut alas, this is no place for me.
