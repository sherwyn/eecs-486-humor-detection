I didn't even use the toilet facilities so I shan't complain about them, it seems that aspect of this place has been well and truly covered by previous reviews.

The interior was very bright and open, with just a few tables and simple chairs arranged in the shop front. \n\nAnd so I walk up to the counter with a smile and a greeting to whom I assume was the owner, and was welcomed with a scowl. I gazed up to the board above his head displaying clearly what fillings I could have, yet found myself squinting to try and decipher the crude pictures of the types of sandwich available (toasted, non toasted, baguette, wrap etc). Upon enquiring that these strange hieroglyphics represented, I was again greeted with a very rude response from the man behind the counter along with any enquiry from him as to what I was doing there (?!?). At this point, if it hadn't been for my increasingly ravaging hunger, I'd have simply walked out.  \n\nYet persist I did and ordered a sweet chilli chicken toasted sandwich with a dash of mayo. Yet what I received, as I found out later, was a overly chewy sweet chilli chicken cold sandwich with garlic mayo. Not a great combination at all, it tasted foul. Upon attempting to take a seat in his empty cafe, I was informed by a series of grunts that I had not paid to sit in and that I would have to leave. I was in no mood to argue and so leave I did. On the way out the door, I stopped to take note of the opening hours. Upon seeing this, the owner came forth from the counter and ushered me off the premises. \n\nOverall, the experience was one of extremely unfriendly (bordering on hostile) staff and poor quality of food. I hadn't even been offered brown or white bread, and the order was wrong.

I saw a dentist out in a rural area, who told me I had an impacted wisdom tooth, but said he didn't feel comfortable extracting it. After toughing it out for about a week, I couldn't stand it any longer and started calling every oral surgeon in the Charlotte area to see who could take me within 24 hours. Dr. Marashi's office got me in for a consultation the same day, I believe, and scheduled the removal for the next morning. I opted for full sedation, even though it wasn't going to be covered by my insurance, because I just wanted to get it over with in the easiest possible way. \n\nThe day of the visit, everything went great. He and his staff were calm, professional and welcoming. He handled the IV sedation himself, and I didn't feel a thing. One minute, I was lying in the chair in excruciating pain, and the next, I was in the recovery room, and it was all over. He sent me home with detailed instructions, some prescription pain medication, and an antibiotic. I used the pain medication the first night, and then was able to switch to Advil the next day. I had some tenderness in the area, but absolutely no facial swelling or bruising. \n\nSo why not five stars? Because Dr. Marashi was supposed to call and check on me that night, and he didn't. He also didn't return my call when I left him a message about a concern I was having (which turned out to be nothing). Is that a huge deal? No, but it made me feel like I received a lower standard of postoperative care because I was a one-time patient from out of town. \n\nAnother reason for the four star review: when I got back to Chicago, I started experiencing pain around the area where the wisdom tooth had been removed.  I assumed it was a dry socket issue, but my dentist discovered that I had an infection and significant bone loss in the molar adjacent to the site of the wisdom tooth removal. He thought it was possible that the pain I had been experiencing in North Carolina had been caused by these issues, and not by the wisdom tooth. After battling several infections in the molar, and months of pain, I ultimately had to have that tooth removed, as well. Maybe Dr. Marashi was aware of these issues, but he didn't think they needed to be addressed right away. Or maybe he didn't notice it at all.  To be fair, I told him that I had an impacted wisdom tooth when I came in for the consultation, so he was probably just focused on that. \n\nThose frustrations aside, I would go back to his office in a heartbeat if I ever needed oral surgery in the Charlotte area again. Dr. Marashi has a very calm and professional demeanor, which means a lot when you're in pain and you just want someone to take care of you. His staff was also very kind and comforting.

He takes the time to explain to you what is going to happen and how it is going to happen. There are no surprises. You are well prepared by the time you get in the chair. \n2) I chose the sedation because I was a wimp and very scared. It worked great. I have a medical condition, so I could not be sedated 100%, but to be honest it didn't matter. I felt fine and comfortable. \n3) Dr. Marashi is very personable. When I got in the chair he talked to me about movies and what I did today. Honestly, we were chopping it up like we were old homies. \n4) He is on time. \n5) He checked in on me on the evenings after I had surgery. He personally called me to make sure that I was feeling okay. Now that is first class service. \n6) He is cute too! \n7) No pain! I did not have any pain whatsoever after my wisdom teeth extractions! I even went out to eat at the Olive Garden and had a full meal afterwards (and 2 of my teeth had to be cut out)! \n\nCons:\n\n1) He doesn't take insurance, so you do have to pay for the surgery! But who really deals with insurance anymore??? It's worth it to pay for his services.\n\nBottom line: I can't recommend this guy enough.

My excitement sky-rocketed when I noticed this little place opened up so close to home and finally came to check it out a couple weeks ago.  The owner of Le Canard Mort closed down the former Le Resignol and opened this new little taco bar.  I have never been to the other restaurants, but Le Canard Mort has definitely been on my radar, and I cross my finger it will be much better than this.\n\nThere were two of us when we came and thought it was closed because it was so dark and empty.  It could have just been because it was late afternoon during down time, but I've never seen more than 2 people in here at a time anyway.\n\nWe were casually greeted, and we picked up a menu off the table.  It consists of enchiladas ($13-$16), burritos ($9-$12), nachos, and a few salads.  The tacos range from $4.50 to $9 each, or you can choose to get the platter of 2 which includes rice and salad.  And so for a quick lunch:\n\nBlackened Catfish Taco Platter: $14 (2/5 stars)\nThe fish itself was cooked and seasoned well.  However, it was not hot... warm at best.  The yellow mole lacked flavour, and the mango salsa was... meh (I can make way better!).  Overall, a bit dry and lacking in flavour... and heat.  Very disappointed with the \"platter\" aspect since it was a tiny scoop of bland rice with what seemed like canned black beans heated in a microwave and poured on top.  The salad was several lettuce leaves with... I forgot what else (not worth the mention anyway).\n\nShrimp Taco Platter: $14 (1.5/stars)\nShrimp was cooked well, but definitely lacked flavour, chipotle mole was inexistent according to my taste buds.  The tomatillo salsa was alright, but missing the bold taste tomatillo salsas promise to deliver.  Again, a bit dry and I wished I hadn't gotten the platter... double disappointment.\n\nService: (2/5 stars)\n2.5 stars.  The server was nice, but there was really nothing that was done to put her above the McDonald's counter service.  We originally asked to get the food to go, but decided to stay after we got the food.  She brought some utensils, napkins, and bottled sauces, then she reached into our bag and took the packaged sauces back so we wouldn't waste it.  I mean, I hate to waste and would have probably given it back anyway... but SERIOUSLY?!\n\nI am a forgiving person and I believe (almost) everyone deserves a second chance.  Chef's and restaurants have their bad days too, so yes, I will go back ONE DAY to get ONE taco and hope that it will make up for EVERYTHING.

Too much cilantro and lime and it was chunky. It wasn't mushed. I know avocado costs less than $1 Make it worth my while and mush, mush I say! \n\nBut the surprise was the nachos. The corn chips were really tasty (I like my salt!) and with the mix of ingredients they had on top of the chicken, was quite good.

But at 9.99 for lunch buffet, it was certainly worth a try. Going in on the second Monday of June, I was completely satisfied with my meal. \n\nThe decor is clean, modern, yet comfortable. There are white table cloths on the table and the silverware is sparkling. The service was also very attentive and kind. Every time my glass was less than full, it was topped up promptly. The waitress had a smile on he face and genuinely seemed like she enjoyed serving us.\n\nThe selection is a touch smaller than India's Taste, but each item is done very well.  It is certainly now in the top three India buffets I have been in Toronto, and I have been to most all of them. \n\nFirstly, there is your typical salad selections, with a spread of various India pickles, chutneys, dips, and raita. Along with good steamed basmati rice, and papadums, these formed the basics in which most other buffets are the same.\n\nThe butter chicken is made with care, and very fragrant, not too spicy and has the aroma of cream and butter.  Absolutely divine.\n\nGoat curry was extremely tender. Did not fight with it at all. Even my toothless grandmother could chew it with ease.  The flavour was warm, inviting, and satisfying.  A good pair with rice and naan.\n\nThere were three different veggie curry selections this day: eggplant, okra, and mixed veggies. All three were unique and flavourful.  I especially liked the mixed veggies.  Seeing as this is a Nepalese and India restaurant (the owners are obviously Nepalese) the spicing is done a little differently than I am used to, but I am enjoying it a lot more.\n\nSamosa are probably the best I have had in Toronto.  Beats out all others I have had.  The pastry is just thick enough, crisp on the outside yet tender. The filling is spiced potatoes, but cut into very small cubes, much smaller than usual.  This made the filling creamy feeling, yet toothsome. A pleasant divergence from the typical gummy mash that others serve.\n\nThere is actually chicken biryani on the buffet, and I can attest it is better than most others that say they specialize in biryani. The fried noodles are also very good, utilizing their tandoori chicken as the protein.  It has a slightly smoky flavour in the background; what we Cantonese would call the 'qi of the wok'. I couldn't get enough of it.\n\nThe naan was equally impressive. Soft and tender on the inside, with a crisp and smoky crust. You can tell it was freshly made.  Better yet, it was brush with real ghee/butter! Most place use vegetable ghee (I can tell), but this place had naan with the distinct fragrance that only real ghee can give.  Kudos to them.\n\nAs a plus, they had shrimp on the buffet. Sauteed in butter and spices, they were done very well.  I am slightly allergic to shrimp, but I risked it anyway, to get a few pieces in.\n\nDessert was limited, but included my favourites: gulab jamun and kheer.  There was also fresh fruit (watermelon was in season and very sweet) and mango puree with fruits.\n\nLooking at their take-out menu, they even make momos.  I wish they had those on the buffet. As well, as some of their Nepalese specials.  Would make the experience even better.\n\nA stone's throw away from The Host, this place is definitely the superior competitor.  Come and try for yourself.  I can see myself being a regular at this point.", "business_id": "1eomYFLhoxC-y2PGnnNtlg", "stars": 5, "date": "2015-06-08", "useful": 1, "type": "review", "cool": 0}, {"funny": 0, "user_id": "4yGImSwdU9FZxVQIbZql3w", "review_id": "5Ylv_tgQsg2OwkNRTQ1_LQ", "text": "It's closed!

He was also our server...he wasn't rude just...I don't know...kind of depressed or something. Service was just fine.\n\nIt's a small little place with lots of seats. Reservations are not needed. We went for the lunch buffet which was $12 + tax + tip, not $9.99 like the sign in this thread suggests...so something changed.\n\nThey did not have a huge selection. No vinadloo! But, everything I ate was very tasty and filling. They brought fresh nan to the table and more when we asked without charge. All in all, it was a great meal and afterwards I just needed to fall asleep. \n\nI would have no problems coming back here again. It's not the best Indian buffet I've ever been to (that one goes to a place in Hamilton), and I am by no means an expert in Indian food, but this place was just great. \n\n4 stars because the buffet was quite small, but everything was just fine. I'm not a big fan of pakora...(I find it's usually too salty in buffets) but their pakora was fantastic. And they cooked chick peas better than I've ever had...they just popped in your mouth. The butter chicken had giant whole pieces of chicken, too. Nan was super fantastic....BUT EVERYTHING WAS SO FILLING.\n\nI would certainly return again for a quick meal...but I think I may plan to fall asleep in the car afterwards, and before I drive home, because it sure was filling the only thing missing was a nice nap. \n\nAlmost forgot one negative...they were playing some music but it was rather loud. That was a bit annoying but I think they turned it down a little bit (still loud) when we came in so that was nice. \n\nAlso, the server asked if things were 'too spicy' (probably because we are white...I get that a lot) but if anything it was quite under spiced for Indian food.", "business_id": "1eomYFLhoxC-y2PGnnNtlg", "stars": 4, "date": "2015-10-22", "useful": 1, "type": "review", "cool": 0}, {"funny": 0, "user_id": "kIsbQsdH6RbibubAwmdFNg", "review_id": "COqq9JhTGx0YwhyDDDVSpQ", "text": "We went here for Sunday lunch.

I think, in part, this was due to some realistic expectations (thanks Yelpers!) and the fact that it was a super cold day and the hot soup noodles were just what I needed.  The most important point about Liberty Noodle, and this is neither a negative nor a positive, is that it is NOT Asian food.  Yes, it boasts Asian flavours, but there is no authenticity here; and to that point, I don't think it can even consider it Fusion.  Think of it as a place that boasts a creative use of Asian flavours and spice, with attentive service, and you and Liberty Noodle will get along just fine.\n\nFor my lunch, I think the appetizers really shined.  We started with the breaded and fried calamari and shrimp; the breading was light and fried just right, and the wasabi & coriander mayo dip was perfect (note: the wasabi flavor was barely noticeable, but I preferred it, actually).  I took the advice from a fellow Yelper and ordered the Apple Slaw salad - it was a star!  Crunchy, fresh, and the cilantro vinegarette tasted amazing!\n\nThe entrees were exactly as expected, but ultimately, nothing to write home about.  I ordered the Vegetable Miso Ramen.  It came hot and favourful - but, was neither Miso flavoured nor were the noodles the right Ramen consistency.  This is what I mean about the lack of authenticity; if you expected a real bowl of Japanese Ramen, you would be sorely disappointed - but, as a bowl of favourful soup noodles, I would say - go for it!  Given that the word \"Noodle\" is in the name, I feel the need to give Liberty Noodle one piece of advice, which is: change your noodle supplier.  Even if the noodles were cooked longer and more tender, whatever brand you are using doesn't seem to be made for soup noodles - frankly, it does your delicious broth a disservice.  My client ordered the beef curry on rice, which was flavourful, but the beef was cooked a bit tough.  I, myself, would try one of the rice dishes the next time I come.\n\nI think the space is rather cute, very warehouse-chic, and our waitress couldn't have been more friendly or attentive.

We walked the entire store and was pretty much left alone to browse. No one following us around and coming out of their way to check in and hover. Other sales people asked to help in passing while working with other customers. A+ on no pressure sales atmosphere, which was a blessing for my anxiety. After about a half hour, I made my choice of couch and ottoman.  Miriam wrote up the ticket and her manager approved a price match the exact same sectional I found on an online ad from a competitor. \nI purchased the coverage warranty along with a nice storage ottoman and picked a delivery date.  Between getting financing in store through Acceptance Now..which took 2-3 hours, and a pricing mistake, the transaction was seamless.  The reason I am giving them 4 stars instead of 5 is that Miriam wrote down the incorrect price for the ottoman.  I was charged $50 more than advertised. After looking at the invoice and bringing everyone's attention to the mistake, the finance girl said she would have to start a whole new order.

The Roomstore manager(I forget his name) offered a $50 gift certificate that never expires and I took it.

Once she returned to my call she said your appointment is for NEXT Thursday, I was sure that was not as Altered designs had contacted me 3 times that week. Betty was unable to help me fix the problem so I asked to speak to the assistant manager and at that point started to get a little extra attitude from Betty and she said that the assistant manager (Claudia) was \"away from her desk in a meeting\". So I asked Betty if there was a Manager (Tim) that I could speak to and I was given the same excuse, he was in a meeting. So I asked to contact the regional manager and once again was told that he was in a meeting. \n\nI called the corporate contact number that I had to find on my own and I explained the problem. They were helpful but could not help other than asking me to email pictures of the damage and to wait to be contacted later. \n\nThe next day I was contacted by phone and was told that due to the fact that I did not report the damage within 3 days that it would not be under warranty (that we paid extra for) and that the only option that I had was to set up another appointment with Altered Designs and pay for the repair out of pocket.\n\nAfter doing a little research I have learned that the roomstore isn't even a member if the BBB, and has several bad reviews on their products and customer service online.

Our experience at the store was very easy and our sales person seemed knowledgeable. We found a sectional that we liked and were able to customize it for ONLY a $100 more.  Our sales person told us that we would have the couch within 4-6 weeks. \n\nAfter about 3 weeks I called the store to ask for the status of our couch. This is when all the problems started. The store was unable to find our purchase. After a few hours of searching they were able to locate our order. They had the order under the wrong name and the contact phone number was transposed. That is when I started asking questions. They informed me that it was their error and they would update our information. At that same time I was told that our couch would be in their store the week of June 22nd.\n\nThe following week I then called to check the status again. This was my first contact with Ricky (the store manager). He told me that it was his first day at that location and to please go easy on him. I simply asked for an update on our couch. That is when he told me that I was given the wrong information about when the couch was to arrive. He told me that my couch was not even going into production until July 8th. I asked if there was a way to expedite the order? I was told no.\n\nOn July 8th, I contacted Ricky to get an update and he told me that the couch was in production and it would be on a truck by the end of the week. \n\nI then called Tim in their customer service department to ask if there was anything they could do to expedite our order so we could get the couch in the time they had promised. He informed me that he was unable to do anything but provided me with the regional managers contact information.\n\nI contacted Mike Norris with their corporate headquarters and left a message on July 14th to discuss the situation with my couch. That same day I also contacted the store to find out the status of my couch and was told by Ricky that the couch was on a truck and was on its way to the store. I asked Ricky where the couch was coming from so I could get an approximate date of arrival. Ricky told me that the couch was coming from CA and he wasn't sure where. Another lie. \n\nWith trying to reach Mike Norris I was having zero luck. I then contacted Tim in customer service again on July 15th to find out if he could provide me with more information. That is when he informed me that my couch was NOT on a truck and they were hoping to get it on the following day! Another lie!\n\nOn July 16th, I was finally able to reach Mike Norris and I told him of the entire situation. He apologized to me and told me that my couch was on a truck and he would further investigate all of the issues. I NEVER heard back from him. I have left several messages since. \n\nOn July 18th, Ricky contacted me at 10:30 AM and asked if I would like the couch on a same day delivery... I said ABSOLUTELY! He told me that the couch would be on the truck that was departing at 4:00 PM and that the driver would call one hour in advance. I was so excited. They were finally going to do something right. \n\nAt 8:00 PM I had not heard from the delivery truck drivers so I contacted the store. That is when I was told my couch was NOT on the truck. The store manager at that time again apologized and said she would have Ricky call me first thing in the morning.\n\nThe following morning I did not receive a call, but my other half did. The store had left a message telling us that our couch was not going to be delivered until we paid the final balance. We were pissed. Why had no one told us that prior? They had 6 1/2 weeks to get it. We were also told by our sales person on day of purchase that we did not have to pay in full and could pay the remainder of the balance at delivery! Another lie. \n\nI contacted Ricky and was infuriated! After many choice words with him, we were told that because we had chose to customize/special order for our couch we would not receive a refund. We ended up paying the remaining balance and was told again the couch would be there after 4:00 PM with an hour call ahead. \n\nAt about 1:30 PM we received a call that our couch was 20-30 mins out. The delivery driver came to our home and dropped off our couch. Out of curiosity we asked if he had just picked up the couch. Turns out our couch was on the morning delivery truck the entire time. Another lie!\n\nFrom this experience, I will NEVER purchase thru the room store AGAIN and would highly suggest no one else do the same. If you are looking for a headache free company do not buy through them. Also, if you are looking for a company that won't feed you lies, do not go to them!

I'm going to start negative so I can end positive.  \n\nThere is so much of the stuff that feels it's made just a bit too cheaply.  Some of the styles would have been great - 5-10 years ago.  Most of the art and decor items featured around the place are pretty awful.  This may sound nit-picky, but the place feels pretty dark and small in some spots - so you FEEL like you're looking at cheap discount furniture.\n\nHere's the good news.  We aren't all able to buy the $10K sofa w/ the $2K chairs.  Some folks need cheap.  And some folks can't imagine how to put pieces together, so showing things as a whole room can be pretty darn helpful.  While this may not be the furniture you'll be passing down to the next generation - who cares?  If you've got a hyperactive 3 year old or you are struggling with cash, but want something nicer than a thrift store - This is NOT a bad place to go.  \n\nWhen looking for ideas for my house I looked EVERYWHERE for inspiration.  Ya never know where you'll find it.  And the thing I really appreciated about the RoomStore is that if you told a salesperson you were just window shopping for ideas - they left you alone.  They might give you a smile if they saw you again, or check to see if you had questions, but most of them weren't going to be pushy.  I appreciate that.  Years ago my friend's Dad worked there and he really liked the place from an employee point of view.

The duck really needed to be cooked substantially more.  I did, however, leave it up to the chef.  Not something I'll do again here.  The desserts were mostly not made on site (which was obvious from the pictures of them in the menu).  The home made ice cream was pretty good.  The 20 year old tawny port was outstanding.  The service was not good enough for this price point.\n\nAll in all, if the experience had been up to the standard of the ostrich carpaccio, I would have been thrilled and would be writing a five star review.

The first couple visits were great, and for a time it was my favourite restaurant in York Region. The lobsterfest deal was absolutely outstanding and great value. \n\nI also enjoy the regular menu and have never had a problem with the food. Had some amazing desserts here too! I appreciate them making an effort with the menu...there are not many higher end restaurants (I would not consider them fine dining) in the area so if other places were to open in the area I think this place would really need to up their game.\n\nThe service is hit or miss which sucks for someone like me who favours consistency. We had really excellent service twice but all other times I would rate it slightly below average. As other reviewers have stated, the servers seem disinterested and insincere...sometimes they don't seem to fit the ambiance (a few came off like greasy-spoon types). The service is the main reason why we don't go often (initially I wanted to go every weekend!). \n\nThey REALLY need to train their servers to be knowledgeable about wine. They also need to start carrying higher end liquor and spirits...I expect this type of stuff to be table stakes. Any actual fine dining restaurant that's worth its salt would showcase this. \n\nWe went for Valentine's Day in February which was a lovely meal along with nice entertainment care of the piano guy. We've enjoyed his shows more than one time and he's excellent so don't forget to tip him!\n\nAll in all I would say Oakland Hall Inn is \"ok\".

Flavourful and not too salty.  For the main course, I had Chicken Ballentine stuffed with mushrooms & Goat Cheese, served with a Merlot sauce.  This was AMAZING.

I live on the other side of oakville but its worth the drive. \nWhat i love about them.\nDr. Matt, Dr. Laura and Dr. Jenn are all amazing vets but more so they are all good people. What i respect about them is they are always honest and looking into your pets best interest.  \n\nLong story but ill make it short, first came to Dr Matt because my previous vet insisted on a surgery that would cause my dog a ton of pain with a major surgery and for $1400, money wasnt my issue but my dogs well being was. I told them i'd rather spend $5000 on a smaller procedure that would cause less pain but to no avail and i felt they didnt care about looking into different options. I starting asking other dog owners in my neighbourhood an i was told the vets at oakpark have a good reputation for doing what best for animals so i went there for a opinion.  Dr Matt and Dr Laura said they can preform a far smaller procedure that will cause my dog far less pain and recovery time. The surgery went great and costed me only $600 but most importantly my pup bounced back the same day and i couldnt be happier with oak park so i stayed there.  As a client there you get the assurence they have a vast amount of experience and that they are animal lovers who are commited to you pets well being even if it means less profit and that is a rare find. \n\nThey are great at reminding you about upcoming shots that are due and other prevention programs like dental month, hart worm season and so on but what i find very impressive is that they will never push a vacination nor make you feel guilty about the ones you choose to pass on.  All in all this is a great clinic that cares about animals and the experience they offer lets you rest assured that your pet will be the best hands possible. You can read their online bios and youll see how commited these doctors are to their practice.\n\nFrom the doctors to the fromt line staff to the ones who look after the dogs in the boarding area, everyone at this clinic that i've met has been very good to deal with and when i call with short notice they always find away to fit me in the same day.

Dabei besitzt er meiner Meinung nach so viel Aussagekraft und stellt das worum es geht - n\u00e4mlich das Schicksal - wundervoll dar.\n\n\n Der Brunnen ist ist ein Halbrund, an dessen Enden sich zwei Paare befinden. Auf der einen Seite ein gl\u00fcckliches Paar und auf der anderen Seite ein trauriges Paar. Die verschiedenen Emotionen werden durch die Haltung sch\u00f6n eingefangen. In der Mitte des Bogens sitzt die Schicksalsg\u00f6ttin. Sie hat iher Arme weit ausgestreckt, die H\u00e4nde sind allerdings verschlossen. Denn das Schicksal der Menschen bleibt verborgen.\n\n\n (Siehe Foto unten) Inschrift: Aus des Schicksals dunkler Quelle - Rinnt das wechselvolle Los - Heute stehst du fest und gro\u00df - Morgen wankst du auf der Welle\n\n\n Auch wenn der Brunnen inzwischen einige wenige witterungsbedingte Sch\u00e4den genommen hat, fasziniert er mich noch immer und ich bleibe gerne davor stehen und betrachte die Figuren.

Nonetheless, it's important to know (especially for Dave B., who obviously didn't do his research) that this magazine is published by a gentleman who grew up here in the valley and wanted a way to promote all of the great, creative people and activities they are doing by making a free magazine.  He decided this 17 years ago, and, despite pretty much breaking even (it costs money to print and distribute thousands of magazines and no, the ads do not cover the full cost), continues doing so in the name of cultural awareness.  Notice that the photoshoots use local designers, local models, local photographers, and local locations.  The articles are about artwork currently displayed in local galleries, businesses (like restaurants) and bands that local folks have started on their own from meager means, and about up-and-coming events like the taco festival (started by a local), fashion shows (again, utilizing local designers and run by locals - no Dillard's show coverage here) and about people in the valley who are trying to make a difference in our community.  If the magazine doesn't seem critical enough, it's because the people who are the magazine decide what to write about, and therefore don't have to waste pages with hateful criticism when Java can be promoting a local chef or a cool new local jewelry designer.  When it's run by a local, written by locals, and put together in the publisher's dining room, I can't think of any magazine with MORE credibiilty and freedom.  The publisher and writers are meticulous in choosing to write about what moves them rather than what the latest hype is.  That's why you read a story about the man who purchased a building and was designing it into a venue before it was the Crescent Ballroom.  That's also why you'll read the backstory on five locally owned, little-known coffee houses at far ends of the valley.  The candid shots in the back are a tribute to local events the publisher attended but maybe an article hasn't been written about, or to local artists, designers or patrons of the arts.

Also, they're constantly messing up my order. And I'm not talking about picky orders, I'm talking about getting mayo when i ask for none, or being charged for a whole sandwich when I ordered a half because they wrote it down wrong (I order the half and half special!)

There were also half a dozen tables with umbrellas outside, which was very nice, but it wasn't the greatest patio space ever, because it was on a busy corner that had plenty of cars and people going by, but not much atmosphere (the cafe across the street, with a much more spacious terrace and a fountain, seemed to be where all the atmosphere was at).\n\nHowever, my sister and I were dying for some refreshing iced coffees, something that was harder to find in Montreal than I expected. From my trip there, I noticed a lot more Parisian-style cafes and bistros, as opposed to American-style coffee shops.

It's a special type of coffee that's more beneficial than regular coffee (I haven't read too much about it but there's tons of stuff written about it on the interwebs). My barista blended it with a bit of butter and maple syrup to cut the bitterness and the tart taste of the butter. I had it hot and my friend had it iced; I definitely recommend it hot. Oh man, that was probably some of the best coffee I've ever had. It's pretty expensive at $5 for a cup of just coffee (no tax) but that's pretty good considering the quality of the coffee compared to all the sugared up mixed coffee drinks these days. I'd take a cup of this stuff over that junk any day. One of the best things about the bulletproof coffee is that it's not supposed to give you the jitters and anxious side effects like regular coffee, which I hate when I choose coffee for a perk. And it was true, I didn't experience any of the usual anxiety when I drink coffee. Apparently, some people use this coffee as a meal replacement in the morning to get a boost on fat loss...I'll probably stick to drinking it for the taste and the brain boost. Our barista was super nice and explained all this to us and what was in it and how it's made. She was great! \n\nI haven't tried the cross fit facilities (I'm very happily committed to Brass Vixens) but I hear great things and how religious people are about their work out...Who knows, I may try it in the future if I ever want to change things up. My friend and I liked sitting in the space and played a game of Connect Four with our coffee before heading on our way.

I did and I won't give that another try.\n- Because I haven't found an awesome shawarma yet, I'll give them 4/5 for the shawarmas.\n- Overall food: 3/5\n\nPrice:\n- for a downtown location and the quality/quantity, it's pretty good. \n- Price rating: 5/5\n\nDecor:\n- seriously? c'mon... It's a shawarma place. It's called Wrap & Grab. You're not here for the decor. \n- There are a few uncomfortable plastic-y bar stools (I wonder why they couldn't just have regular circular tables and chairs like you have in a cheap cafeteria). \n- There's a TV that plays CP24 all the time. I don't expect many people to sit there, unless they don't want to take the hot shawarma anywhere else.\n- no washroom (so you MUST \"grab\" your food if you want to \"go\"... and by \"go\", I don't mean \"leave\"... =P\nDecor rating: not-existing / 5.\n\nService:\n- I found they are pretty good - fast; understand what you want; will ask you about things you don't specify (hot sauce? garlic? onions? - I assume these are the typical no-nos... I on the other hand want extra everything... but I digress, back to the review:)\n- Respectful - I find this to be an issue with a lot of take-out places. These guys are busy, I don't expect them to laugh and joke with me, but polite \noverall. \n- For certain orders (like the kabab shawarma), it takes time because they cook the kabab right there - the wait is 10 minutes). I call ahead, order over the phone, and show up 10 minutes later.\n- Service rating: 4/5 (I won't give them 5/5 coz it's not a proper restaurant. I'll take off a star to be fair to the other 5/5s I may give. For a take-out place, it's pretty good). \n\nWhy to go there:\n- cheap, quick meal (i speak for the shawarmas. other things - not so much, maybe the smoothies/juices..)\n- good quantity\n- good service\n\nWhy not to go there:\n- definitely not a place to sit and eat (walk over to Nathan Phillips or something nearby)\n- for a first date - uhhh.... =P", "business_id": "0tMhUM4FJy-onBd8ppUDng", "stars": 3, "date": "2011-04-21", "useful": 1, "type": "review", "cool": 1}, {"funny": 0, "user_id": "DzIWV5_hfkPOHSdb-7B0cw", "review_id": "SCB_fBPl691eQS4Z6JC2Iw", "text": "The food was dry and old.

I enjoy a shawarma occasionally (at one time I was eating them 3 times a week).  The guys who originally opened this place has left and it's an odd story cos they're almost like moving nomads.  They were brothers or cousins (I can't recall) and they're Lebanese and polite but not overly so.  I was first introduced to Middle Eastern food about 7 years ago when they had this Pita Express place near Richmond-Victoria streets which has long closed. It was good so that started my search for the ultimate shawarma.  These places are popping up like dandelions (sushi was over populating us but now these places are excessive). \n\nBack to the review on this place.  Like I said, the original guys were on Yonge St. (east side of the street) south of Carlton.  They closed and moved north to 618 Yonge St (between Bloor-Wellesley) to a place called Pita Q and then left there to open Wrap & Grab on Dundas.  They have since left and went back to their original spot called Lebanese Express (it's 399 or 439 Yonge St) and I haven't seen him recently so I assumed he's moved again? The reason I liked their shawarma was because they lightly toasted the pita and they also made a huge one for me (maybe I looked like a buffet eater lol? I don't know... but it was huge and good value).\n\nThe down side is that I'm spoiled so when I get these huge shawarmas that are big and good value, every time I go elsewhere, they're disappointing.  Recently, the shawarma's have been inconsistent in size (sometimes large and sometimes small like a hot dog).  The prices are higher too as they used to be under $4 but now they're closer to $5 with our HST.  Hmmm, that makes the Subway sandwich more attractive if I'm hungry lol.  But it's the taste I crave and the way he toasts his pita.  He does leave his mark wherever he goes as they still follow his formula.  The service here is OK as they're all business (not too many smiles or jokes unless you speak their language).  It's really 3.5 stars due to their inconsistency but the place is clean and the shawarma is still tasty and good value.", "business_id": "0tMhUM4FJy-onBd8ppUDng", "stars": 4, "date": "2010-11-02", "useful": 2, "type": "review", "cool": 2}, {"funny": 0, "user_id": "aL0XR0Nt_9NHbFpgdvYTQw", "review_id": "Xwm4vxCX7oLJx-BDnJVmug", "text": "This place has wicked shwarma and the price is good too.

I've seen Johnny's Place many times driving down Craig Street, but have never thought too much about it. The place is a small, stand-alone building and looks very much like your local dive bar from the outside. Typically your local Pittsburgh dive is dirty, old, and \"has personality\", which is really the regulars' way of saying \"I know the bartender and all my drunk friends go there\". So, thinking all that, I've never thought about going in there. Boy was I missing out!\n\nWe walked in and I was immediately proved wrong in many ways. It is clean, not old, well decorated, and really did have personality. The owner/bartender was a very attentive server (read: refills my beverage regularly without me having to hunt him down) and, from hearing his interactions with other tables, very obviously proud of his food, and his establishment. The walls are completely covered with dedications to Pittsburgh sports - the Steelers, the Penguins, the Pitt Panthers, and lots of photos and autographs. Johnny has obviously welcomed the best of da Burgh's athletes. If it's good enough for them.... Rather than your neighborhood dive bar, this place resembles more of your neighborhood sports bar. \n\nNow, on to the food. I had the Teriyaki Cheese Steak and it was pretty tasty. I heard Johnny talk about his Teriyaki Buffalo Wings to someone else, and they seemed to like it. I think he does a few dishes with his Teriyaki Sauce. Instead of the typical Japanese teriyaki flavor, this homemade sauce is a little more sweet and sour tasting. It's good. The menu is not your typical bar food menu. It has the staples, but also twists on \"normal\" dishes. I'm definitely going back to try different things. \n\nOne patron was walking out and said \"You can order anything, you can't go wrong.\" I don't know if he's Yelp elite (prob not) but it's still a bold statement for any diner.\n\nSo, definitely try it out if you're around the neighborhood. I'm not sure how crowded it gets in the evenings or during games, but it's a great lunch place for sure. I bet a lot of locals love Johnny's Place.

You can actually see the cooks cut the potatoes while you wait if you order at the take out counter... The fries are VERY good, the real, right way: blanched and fried; and the sauce is very tasty, real: made from beef stock, not chicken base or barbecue sauce; and the spices and herbs in it are spot on. Not too salty, not too thick, just right. As for the cheese curds, true, they are coming out of the refrigerator, which WOULD be a real dissapointment if one were to eat them as is...

The interior design is very calming and it's definitely a treat to the eyes. There are seating arrangements for everybody (individual diners, pairs/couples, small families, large groups). As well, they tend to play classical music over the speakers to give it a 'classy' touch, which is an interesting move for a McDonald's.\n\nHowever, my one complaint about this place is that, because this is basically the only McDonald's in Pickering, they get a fair number of rowdy teens in there. Basically every time I've sat in this restaurant, save for late at night, there's been groups of individuals messing with the surroundings and yelling profanities within close proximity to children. My only concern with this establishment is that employees don't bother to remove persons that are disrespecting the location, even if they've exceeded the posted 30 minute seating limit and are acting incredibly disrespectful.\n\nBut, even though they do tend to get at least one group of rowdy guests here, every other aspect of the establishment redeems it.

Most of the jewelry was appraised in 2009 (another state) as part of a family estate and a few were given to us by one of other mothers. Before selecting Diny's I first did a lot of online research about what credentials to look for when seeking an appraisal. Of all the jewelers in the Madison area, Pete Diny is the only one who is both a Graduate Gemologist (GIA) and a Master Graduate Gemologist Appraiser (IJO). I needed someone who was knowledgable of old jade, vintage watches and pearls. When first interviewing Pete I said that I had a lot of old jewelry but I didn't know if the pieces were costume or real. He said to bring everything in and he would be happy to look through what I had. I set up an appointment. We had agreed that he would only do a formal appraisal on jewelry that he thought would come in with an insurance value over $1000. He looked at all the pieces I brought in, separating out the costume jewelry and the pieces above and below the minimum. He was very pleasant to work with, respectful of the pieces and extremely familiar with older jewelry and took pictures of the pieces to be appraised. I could tell right away that he really enjoys looking at and appraising estate jewelry. I was given a copy of the picture of the collection he would appraise to take with me. I brought the pieces in on a MOnday and the appraisals were ready before Friday. I knew that I could have paid a lot less to have the jewelry appraised somewhere else. I had some appraised at another long time jeweler a few years ago but the appraisals came back with no reference images on the write up. Each Diny's appraisal includes a picture of item - which I appreciated as some of my jewelry is very similar in appearance. Diny's also offers a lifetime appraisal so I can bring in a piece anytime to have it reappraised. Great. Because the value of gold has increased 4x from 2009, I was pleasantly surprised that the value of the pieces appraised in 2009 increased at least 4x. On MOnday I contacted my insurance company to increase the insurance value of my wedding ring since I enjoy wearing it. Having the lifetime appraisal policy is well worth the cost of the appraisals. I felt confident that I received a professional appraisal and that my jewelry was in good hands at all times. I would highly recommend Diny's Jewelers.", "business_id": "2krO3ID3on0gOI4-Ce8uuQ", "stars": 5, "date": "2015-01-19", "useful": 1, "type": "review", "cool": 0}, {"funny": 0, "user_id": "Ausa_ION90sqcA3tXEDsEA", "review_id": "XN8noQwsljdoRQ_-vq02sg", "text": "Our first encounter with Diny's was at a bridal show this past January, about a week after our engagement. Diny's was the only jewelry stand we stopped at that day. I have a very unusual engagement ring; it's an antique ring that was given to me after my grandmother's passing and has a scalloped edge that is difficult to match a band to. They showed us a few rings and one in particular stood out. We also looked at men's rings and took down the numbers for both rings. Last month, after looking only online at other rings, no other ring stood out like the ones we saw at Diny's stand. We decided to go and check it out at the store one more time. Nick Diny helped us out that day and we also realized he was the one from the bridal show that showed us the rings originally. Those were the only rings we looked at, and they were the rings we ended up buying. \n \nBecause I have never had my grandmother's ring appraised and knew nothing about it, I asked Nick if he could take a look at it and tell me anything about it. He noticed right away that one of the prongs holding on to the largest diamond was damaged and warned me that I probably shouldn't be wearing the ring in that condition, something I would have never known on my own. Upon closer inspection, he also noticed that there was some engraved detail work that had been worn down over the years and stated that they could restore it to it's original 1940's look. Another detail I would not have known had I not had him look at it. It took a few weeks, but when it came back it was amazing!! It was already a fabulous ring and I was not sure how it could look better, but it looks absolutely beautiful! It's like a whole new ring! I actually cried on the ride home from picking it up because I already loved my ring, but now I love it even more. \n \nThe whole experience was wonderful. We didn't feel pressured and it was very comfortable. It took a lot of trust to give up my grandmother's ring, but I never once felt worried. It took a week longer than expected because they were not 100% happy with some of the detail work and wanted it perfect. That attention to detail was very much appreciated, especially with something that holds such great sentimental value to me.

This embroidery was supposed to be the amazing finishing touch to the present but instead, Embroid Me ruined it.\n\nIf you know anything about golf, you would know that the names on golf bags are always in CAPS. For example: JOHN SMITH, not John Smith. I brought the detachable pocket from the $180.00 golf bag into Embroid Me and picked out a font and paid $25.00. I was so thrilled to go in this afternoon to pick up the embroidered pocket and what does it say?? John Smith, not JOHN SMITH.\n\nIt's a good thing I know a few things about golf, so I wasn't completely fooled by what Kevin at Embroid Me had to say. I was advised that only company names are in all caps...individual golfer names are usually in regular print as to not scream out the name. Completely incorrect. Check the guys on tour...their names are all in CAPS.\n\nKevin, who seems like the manager, suggested that I bring him another pocket so he could embroider it for me right away. Great solution if the pocket didn't require me buying another golf bag for $180.00. I am still trying to see if I can purchase another pocket from TaylorMade individually. If not, I will have to gift the golf bag as is. \n\nLong story short...if they're in the embroidery business and advertise themselves as being able to customize golf bags, then do it correctly. Don't try to brush customers off with BS explanations about why their embroidery came out incorrectly.\n\nThis place doesn't give you any sort of receipt or carbon copy to show your order. Kevin also admitted that he assumed regular letters when taking my order, not all caps (although he should've known!?).

When I picked up my order, I asked her if there was no salt on the fries and no ketchup on the burger because it wasn't written on the receipt. She accused me of not saying I didn't want salt. I had to wait again for both items to be redone. Notice that there was nobody else in the restaurant. When the redo was done, I asked for the honey mustard sauce. She played games with me. She didn't want to give it to me. After practically arguing with her for several minutes and her attempts to give me plain mustard, that I do not like nor eat, she finally gave me what I asked for.  She was not pleasant about it.  She was also inappropriately dressed with tight leggings too long for her, all hiked up and no skirt, no long shirt, no tunic, nothing covering the leggings, just bare sloppy leggings.  She looked dreadful and her attitude sucked.  It was my second visit and I won't go back, except for freebies that come in the mail.  I don't care to be treated like that and when only one couple came in while I was waiting for my order, I would hate to think how she would handle herself in a busy restaurant. She had a long name that started with C.  I couldn't read it because she kept turning around. How this girl retains this job when she is so miserable to people, doesn't smile, doesn't say thank you - is beyond me.\nI let their head office know.  They care.  I was promptly emailed back and asked for more details.  I was told they want to fix the problem.  I suppose it takes a while to weed out bad employees.

For example, some urns we had specifically picked out in her store were replaced by little pots covered in fabric.\n\nThe week of the wedding, she finds out that she can't order the flowers we requested as there aren't that many in stock--- Also some flowers don't come in the color we decided on with her, so she changed the order. Shouldn't she have checked months ago when we decided?!?\n\nThe estimates on price we had gone over for months in advance changed drastically the week before the wedding. Fine, she didn't include a few things in the estimate, BUT when it's a $600 increase... it kind of defeats the purpose of an estimate!!\n\nOh yeah, and the mandap (like a four-posted canopy/gazebo under which we have the actual ceremony) that she set up FELL DOWN!

Luckily, our hotel's coordinator got it back up and screwed in and secured, something that should have been done from the beginning (maybe if she'd come on time?).

I was introduced to Karen and I am so thankful   I was because she made my dream wedding possible! In ONE day we planned out my entire Mehndi (a colorful pre-wedding event) and Wedding decor. She understood the special requirements of a Pakistani/Indian wedding...the bright colors, the furniture requirements, the sometimes over the top grandness that our weddings are known for. She understood my needs so well that if she couldn't find exactly what we were looking for...SHE MADE IT FROM SCRATCH (i.e all the ORNATE stage seating for 2 events). Did I mention she did this all in 3 weeks?\n\nThe thing about Karen is that she will make your event HER event...every time I met with her, she was excited, brimming with ideas, and so encouraging. If anyone is looking for a decorator who understands Pakistani/Indian weddings please please please save yourself the hassle and headache I went through with my initial decorator and hire Karen directly! She can do all your staging, flowers, center pieces, aisle walkways, entrance ways, dance floor decor, etc.. And she will do it with care, honesty, and sincerity. My mom is still getting calls from guests who say they hadn't seen such  a beautifully decorated wedding before! Plus, my husband is from Chicago and the Pakistani/Indian weddings there are decorated to the MAX and well, let's just say the Chicago guests were IMPRESSED! \n\nFrom start to finish, Karen was professional and yet sincere and that's the type of person you want to trust your wedding to!", "business_id": "OX2zVcTe2tu_JSrsQda__g", "stars": 5, "date": "2012-07-18", "useful": 0, "type": "review", "cool": 0}, {"funny": 0, "user_id": "zlY94JiW6bfSawPdnKc8-Q", "review_id": "wAt4hzIrrlVBbzUfCBY1hg", "text": "We worked with Karen for the decorations and rentals for our wedding.

The venue didn't have storage for them so we had to get a room at the hotel to store over night.  Not only did Brenda coordinate the delivery of the flowers, but she showed up at the time of delivery to ensure that they were safe, came back in the evening to check on them and showed up bright and early the morning of the wedding to check on them yet again.  On the day of the wedding, they carefully moved the flower arrangements from the hotel room to the ballroom and set up our tables.  Then after the wedding, her staff broke down the decor and returned the rented vases to the florist the following day.  They even helped us to put the final touches on a couple of our designs.  They can do it all and execute with extreme care and professionalism.\n\nEverything turned out exactly as we'd discussed.

I now have to come back AGAIN later this week for them to give me the amount my prescription says. How does that work? Not to mention that I ordered the meds on Friday and was told they would be ready the next morning on Saturday. It's Sunday. Almost every time I've gone to pick up my medicine it has been an absolute hassle. It seems that when one pharmacist makes a promise they do not pass it on to the others so there is a ton of confusion between pharmacy employees. This is getting to be ridiculous, and even though Walgreens isn't in range of my insurance or my house I'd rather go back to using them if this continues. No one else seems to be having as much trouble as I am when picking up my meds, and I've already tried with at least two different pharmacists to smooth out the problems they had getting my prescriptions transferred over already.

If you're thinking of staying here, save yourself the money, headaches and lack of rest and simply stay at Days Inn, right next door (stayed there last year and ironically it was one of the better hotel stays that I've had). \n\nFirst off, when we checked in, our king size room was located on the 2nd floor. My wife prefers top floors so as to avoid the noise associated with people walking around on the floor above us. I asked about changing to a top floor room and was told that there were only rooms with two queen beds on the third floor. I'm not sure where hotels get their beds, but a king is not a king as the rest of the world knows it, and so it is with hotel queens. We certainly weren't going to be comfortable trying to both squeeze into a queen bed. In the end, we decided to risk the upstairs noise and stay with the king bed. \n\nOur room (211) was right above and to the side of the lobby. Our first impression of the room was \"where's the rest of it\". Our bedroom at home is quite literally larger than the entire hotel room. The hotel advertised itself as \"newly remodeled\". I guess this remodel only extended to the tile on the floor of the lobby. The interior of the room, specifically the furnishings was certainly dated. The small TV (CRT style, not LCD as one might hope to find in a newly remodeled hotel) sat directly on the low slung dresser -- far too low to be able to watch while relaxing in bed unless you sit up propped up with pillows behind your back -- but if that's your plan, be sure to bring your own pillows as the hotel only sees fit to provide four small throw pillows that act as bed pillows. These were overly soft and quite literally about 18\" square. No support whatsoever. Good thing my wife brought her own - too bad I didn't follow her lead. Want to know what's on TV? Start channel flipping as there is no program guide - either paper or on a TV channel. The hotel provides free HBO, but good luck finding out what is playing as the HBO program guide was from last month. At least we could see what we missed. \n\nThe bathroom lacks a sink and mirror as those amenities are out in the entry hall of the room. I'm not sure I like the idea of handling a bathroom door knob that was handled by others without washing their hands first (because you can't since there is no sink in the bathroom). There is a small table with two chairs, as well as a luggage rack and floor lamp, however utilizing either the rack or lamp renders one of the chairs unusable due to the overly cramped quarters -- we had to move the floor lamp into the entry/sink area just to be able to use the chair (and of course put our luggage elsewhere while we used it). \n\nAs for the peace and quiet one would expect while \"relaxing\" at a hotel, forget it. Within 10 minutes of entering our room, it sounded like people were fighting and tossing furniture around in the hallway. I went out to investigate the noises and found four or five young men around the pool table that is right outside the door of the room, with two of them on the floor. \"We're in a wrestling team\" was their excuse. Maybe I'm wrong, but I would think wrestling should be done somewhere except the hallway of a hotel. As if that weren't enough, the front door of the building was poorly adjusted, and every time somebody would enter or exit, the door would slam shut and make a very loud noise. This continued well into the evening, making falling and staying asleep an arduous task at best. The icing on the cake was when the TV in the lobby was turned on at 7 in the morning with the volume blaring. At least due to the lousy acoustics of the lobby and the poor sound insulation of the room it seemed that loud. At any rate, it's pretty bad when the lobby TV and front door noises keep a second floor guest from sleeping. \n\nLastly, if you read this far and you still insist on trying this place out, make sure you check your billing detail when you check out. The room includes a safe, and you will be charged for it whether you use it or not. Now, if the safe is part of the room, just like the TV, air conditioner, fridge or microwave, why isn't it included in the room rate? When you check out, you will notice a $1.50/night (plus tax) charge for the safe. If you object to the charge, they will remove it, but you'd be better off objecting to the imposed charge up front (in fact, the manager claims that guests are supposed to tell them that they won't be using the safe at check in -- that's assuming the guest gets the memo about the practice first). \n\nWould I stay here again? Yeah, right! I think not! Would I recommend it to my worst enemy? Maybe for the pleasure of knowing they will suffer, but even then I'd feel guilty. \n\nTwo words -- STAY AWAY!", "business_id": "3zPeoY0HwIEW-HlX4iXRlQ", "stars": 1, "date": "2010-12-09", "useful": 1, "type": "review", "cool": 0}, {"funny": 0, "user_id": "TUjZ_0JcFXbMueU5d4T08w", "review_id": "eNUhW4ZmrUSmk17Cc3l3qg", "text": "The staff is so friendly and make you feel welcomed throughout your whole stay.

Breakfast is basics for on-the-go.  Bring your own Pack-N-Play - they charge $10/day to use theirs.\n\nLOCATION: Good (depending on where your other activities are, of course).  The hotel is just off Bell Road, far enough that you don't hear the road traffic from the room at all.  There are several fast food restaurants and a sit-down eatery within a mile in case you need to grab a bite to eat.\n\nSTAFF:  Friendly and efficient, though a bit slow to respond at times (as I entered the lobby to check in, one staffer was at the desk but turned to enter the office.  She remained there with another staff member chatting and laughing, not noticing me for about 5 minutes)\n\nWIFI - free and fairly quick.\n\nROOM/ACCOMMODATION:  We had a King Suite.  The room was very large.  There were two over-sized chairs in the living room as well as a sofa that pulled out for an additional bed.  This still left plenty of room for us to re-arrange a bit to fit our daughter's pack-n-play.  The bedroom was separated by a full door for privacy.  The bed was comfortable - not too soft, not too hard.  The pillows are small squares and on the softer side so I took the advice of another review I read on Yelp! and brought our own pillows.  The cable has no guide so if you're going to watch television, prepare to channel surf to find what you want.  The bathroom was separate from the bedroom allowing access to all guests without going through the bedroom.  The kitchen area was nice and included a refrigerator, microwave, cabinets, drawers, sink and coffee maker.  There were fans in both the living room and bedroom which were very appreciated.  Although the temperatures were in the high 60's / low 70s during our stay, the A/C units couldn't keep the room cool enough.  The fans more than made up for that.\n\nDISADVANTAGES:\n -- Breakfast was mediocre.  There were hot biscuits and gravy but the rest was slim pickings and highly processed.  If you need a fast pick-me up or just something to hold you over until you get to where you're going, you're set.\n-- Kitchen area included wine glasses, but no other plates, cups or silverware, you'll need to bring your own if you dine in the room.  The water from the tap was EXTREMELY cloudy (I could not see through it when I filled the coffee pot) so I suggest cleaning anything you use anyway (including the coffee pot) with bottled water before use.\n-- A/C was lacking, two small units (one in the living area, one in the bedroom) which did not work sufficiently to keep it cool.  The fans were great and more than made up for that, but if you can't sleep with a fan on, you'll want to take this into consideration, especially in the hotter AZ months.\n-- The window in the bedroom (Suite 218) was cracked and repaired with clear tape only.\n-- The light fixture as you entered the suite was missing. It was just a bare bulb.\n-- One of the lights in the bathroom was non-functional.\n\nBecause it was Thanksgiving weekend, and these minor issues didn't hamper our stay, I did not mention them to the staff.  I would have upon check-out, but I wasn't asked about my stay.  It was difficult to get to the front desk at checkout time as one of the staffers was mopping the lobby area between the front door and the reception desk anyway, so we made a quick departure as to not mess up the freshly mopped floor.", "business_id": "3zPeoY0HwIEW-HlX4iXRlQ", "stars": 4, "date": "2015-11-29", "useful": 0, "type": "review", "cool": 0}, {"funny": 0, "user_id": "zqxeWa3zx19V2Iu9F-Lqog", "review_id": "IrOzOmiSgZaJ7Lfdsp6xFw", "text": "We picked this hotel because of the good rates and I'm so glad we did.

Had some great convo with Lisa and a local Vegasan, gambled a bit, and even got to see \"Barbie\" turn in a handwritten application exclaiming her ability to pass a drug test! Yay Barbie! Probably had to be there for that, but trust me...only in Vegas. Judging a book by its cover, we probably would've ran from this place after a few minutes. But hang out for a little while and read a bit deeper into this classic, and you'll be hooked like my wife and that 50 Shades of Grey stuff. Stop in, stay a while, and I'll bet you'll find a place in you Vegas heart for Hammer & Ales.

The sign out front read \"2 dollar beers\" and \"PUB- GRUB- PLAY\".  We were from out of town so we didn't know the area but we couldn't have had better luck.  We had gone to the \"LAX\" night club at the Luxor hotel and casino the night before and were not pleased.   So we were looking for a bar where we could actually carry a conversation without yelling.  We were the only ones in the place when we first got there as it was earlier in the night, but a small crowd showed up as the night went on.  The bar tender recommended either the Philly cheesesteak, or the open face ribeye.   We both ordered the ribeye for a cool 10 bucks and were thoroughly amazed.  I would have easily paid $25-30 for this thing!  It was the best steak I had in half a year.  I also got a chance to sample the fries, and the chicken strips which were also amazing.  I can't say enough about the hospitality of these people.   They were friendly, experienced and accommodating.  We had planned on having dinner, a couple beers and a few games of pool and spending an hour or two in this place.  The hospitality and quality of the establishment kept us from leaving, and before we knew it we had been there for 6 hours.    I'll just say that if I lived in the area I would definitely frequent this place.  I spent 3 days and 2 nights in Vegas and my best memory of it was this bar.  Once you get tired of losing your money in the casinos and paying ridiculous prices for weak drinks come here and start really enjoying yourself.

I will agree that the hummus is not as flavorful as some I had, but it was still very fresh.  Since it's a family recipe, I just thought maybe their family didn't like as strong of a flavor to it?

I trusted them completely to do their work while I was out of the house. The job was completed from estimate to finish in about a week. it is wonderful to come home to my new and improved colors. It seems like a brand new home. They also painted the interior of my daughter's house to prepare it for sale. It looked so good that it was sold within a week of completion. If you want a new and improved appearance to your living space, don't hesitate to call them. I know I won't if I ever need to paint again.", "business_id": "2Gfy-1_1NNGUst6NydOuxQ", "stars": 5, "date": "2016-04-21", "useful": 1, "type": "review", "cool": 0}, {"funny": 0, "user_id": "QHyWbzSDFTlWYeC2ee_WUQ", "review_id": "8irheZI23TaZwPdn-gAlhA", "text": "Best painting company in Vegas!
