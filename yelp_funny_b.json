If you're not careful you could walk right past this place as the tiny re-purposed house has only a tiny sign to let you know it exists.\n\nEntering, I was greeted by a crowd of locals, a room full of oscillating ceiling fans, and an artistic decor that would make an Toronto Hipster weep with joy.

The cappuccino was amazing! The beans were a unique custom, freshly roasted/ground blend, and the latte/foam art on the top was art all by itself. $3.15 for the Cappuccino (taxes in).\n\nEveryone here is incredibly friendly and I certainly recommend you come here if you're looking for great service, good food and a little peace and tranquility in the middle of your day. \n\nCash Only!", "business_id": "5m-WYdtIUgfvZdStqmSiRA", "stars": 4, "date": "2013-01-16", "useful": 4, "type": "review", "cool": 5}, {"funny": 3, "user_id": "ndtF7YJNv02TevAyhrxJlw", "review_id": "UMRrjA_FoIWSPqOSF4bjxw", "text": "Let me first clarify that I am Vietnamese.  All Asians know when they hear a restaurant is good you gotta ask, \" Did a white person tell you that or were they Asian?\"  Come on you know you do it too. And i'm not trying to say that people of the light skin can't appreciate Asian food ( I have a non asian friend who eats lots of asian food I wouldn't eat) , but come on when you've been eating it almost everyday for your entire life you know a little bit more than someone who's had it a dozen times.\n\nMy review is a little skewed in the fact that I haven't had too many things here.  I've really only had  cha gio bun tit nuong (Spring rolls, and grilled pork with noodles) , ca kho (fish cooked in a clay pot) and canh cua (sour seafood soup).  Let's start with the good.  The cha gio bun tit noung is good.  The cha gio particularly is good, I wish they would give you more they cut up one sorta small one but it's tasty.  I'm sorta jealous that mine cha gio isn't as good, i can't figure out what it is too.  The nuoc mam is pretty good, they julianne carrots in it ( pet peeve when they don't at a restaurant) and they serve it with green onions that are in oil ( hate when restaurants don't do this either).  It's tasty this is what I typically get when I go here.  The other two not so hot, the ca kho was crazy salty, and the canh chua was just blah.  I'm not sure what they are known for at this place, but that's how a lot of Vietnamese restaurants are they make a few things that are great and they specialize in those and just have the other stuff just cause.   \n\nI haven't eaten the Pho cause I am a snob to pho.  I really don't eat Pho anywhere, I really only eat Pho made by my dad (My dad used to have a pho shop)    I will maybe eat Pho in Orange County, NYC, or Toronto.  I'm North Vietnamese we came up with it I know my Pho.   and I'm a purist in that I think Pho should be eaten plain, no hoison no siracha, only a bit of lime.  So sorry no pho review, but it didn't smell bad. \n\nAnd all these reviews about the decor and untidyness.  Well that's just Vietnamese restaurants, and to be perfectly honest I don't think it's too bad even considering it's a Vietnamese joint.   Ha, and I know more than one person who says when choosing between two Asian restaurants in Cali, they go for the one with the lower letter rating.

So, Tempe was the answer until on our way there we noticed this retro looking hamburger joint with a Miller High-life banner hanging in the window.  We decided to skip the drive and go for it, there was even a patio.\nWe walked up and the first thing we saw was a freaky mannequin dressed in a stripper/\"nurse\" outfit placed in the window of the 500 sq ft building.  As soon as we entered the front door, it became clear that the mannequin wasn't the only one sporting this skimpy attire.  The waitresses also had on cheeky skirts, white fishnets, and boobs popping out of their blouses.  This was a sorry attempt as the class of the place left me feeling like I was at some Mesa dive bar, or better yet Band-Aids with burgers.  Creepy men were scattered throughout the tiny place drooling.  Just when I thought it couldn't get any stranger (or funnier!) I spotted the makeshift  bulletin board of the waitresses (all 2 of them) with 50+ pictures of them complete with handwritten captions, and numerous old creepy men like the ones there that afternoon.  It was hard for to believe this place was real, or that someone actually took it seriously!\nWith grumbling bellies and confused looks on our faces we decided to order a couple of PBR's (either PBR or High-life the only 2 choices of brew), and took it to the cement patio.

John Anderson's looks very much like your run of the mill small neighbourhood diners. They serve breakfast, lunch and dinner eats of the diner variety.  It's in a location where this type of food is severely lacked, so they have a niche here.\n\nNow I got a quick homeburger combo with added cheese which cost a very reasonable price of just under $6 after tax (drink not included). The burger does take a while to make so make sure you're not in a hurry like I was. I believe if you can, call and order ahead for pick up cause the wait was about 10-15 mins.\n\nNow once I got back to work to eat my lunch, the burger was literally drenched in grease.  Now I know burgers aren't the healthiest food available, but let's be honest... I wasn't expecting this.  The wax paper that was used was pretty much dripping in grease and the fries... well they're also of the greasy variety.  They are the thick cut fries and weren't really crispy at all (I had some fresh on the way back to work).  So they were deep fried without any REAL purpose as you probably could have baked them and would have turned out the same.  \n\nFirst bite, not bad... but I got a feeling the grease played a huge part.  The patties weren't dry (grease) and they did give me a ton of toppings.  I got the traditional garnish with ketchup and mayo.  The taste was there, but if you can feel worse than McDonalds, here's your winner.  I wasn't thrilled with the fries as I think they were deep fried without any purpose.  They were a soggy and uninspired mess.  The only possible redemption would have been, if it was a poutine, maybe... but c'mon fries not crispy, sorry not feeling it.\n\nSo overall, John Anderson's isn't horrible.  I mean if you're a healthy type I would say stay far away.  If you can feel worse than McD's, here's the place to visit.  I haven't tried their breakfast or dinner, so who knows maybe it's better for those meals.  I think if I am really in need of grease, I would come back.  Cause it wasn't bad in that regard.. the flavour was there and it's very reasonably priced.  But for this level of unhealthiness, I think I rather go to something just as horrible like Popeye's Fried Chicken, but that's my take... what's yours?", "business_id": "UUT3f05dbse6ar-2Ws5GUA", "stars": 2, "date": "2011-08-03", "useful": 4, "type": "review", "cool": 4}, {"funny": 3, "user_id": "CvIEHZF79KLrpNachZzDjA", "review_id": "5ZMpN6wd9TmyBlAj5ILynA", "text": "GROSS.

Nothing too much more that I could ask for. The location of the hotel was a little isolated though. We happened to be out there on business dealing with Rangers Spring Training Baseball. Like most suburbs, you'll need a car to get to where you're going...even though it is located close to a couple of eating spots in case you get hungry.\n\nSurprise is a rapidly growing town, and the newer hotels have probably surpassed this one in popularity...but I'm here to tell you that if most of the town is booked up, and you see this Quality Inn as one of your options, go for it!", "business_id": "3zPeoY0HwIEW-HlX4iXRlQ", "stars": 3, "date": "2015-03-28", "useful": 5, "type": "review", "cool": 3}, {"funny": 4, "user_id": "iSC96O2NjQc3JExGUHQG0Q", "review_id": "-a4mqwxVXtUgRCRdMcKPXQ", "text": "I came here after CMYE with my roommate Roy E too keep the party going and the drinks flowing.

Not that it was all bad the things that did stand out for me was like outside of the building with the art work and like the well lit sign that can see from the road. It located in industry area one that only business other then strip club down the road open at night. So make sure look for the sign or else drive right by it. I like all the widescreen televisions that inside the bar couple of them nice size and perfect chill watch sports (last night case primetime Olympic coverage) drink beers talk stories with friends. They have separate room that has a pool table and dart board. Not sure if they do the world beer stamp card from the show. I like the chalkboard world map on the wall. The bartender she was friendly, on it came too our beers ask us before close too empty, and she has this positive upbeat energy vibe. Really in the end Hammer & Ales still dive bar for me. As for Dive bars nothing that really stood out for me thankfully bartender and hanging out with roommate made the most of first time visit. I know they serve food but after the food coma was in from CMYE last thing on my mind so never asked the bartender for the menu, She never asked us if wanted one. They do have nice selection of beers on tap too choose from although last night felt like looking at the taps few that was out.  \n\nThe area is not exactly the most safe area and coming out of the bar feel like looking over my shoulder something bad going too happen.

BUT I've been very happy with the promptness of delivery (and it comes in a lovely white Philosophy box) and the delicious scents (I love stepping out of the shower smelling like a cinnamon bun!).\n\nI also think they have a great business model set up. They regularly offer codes for free lipglosses and 4 oz bottles of three-in-ones, an excellent way to let customers try a product without purchasing it. They also let you choose samples at checkout. I might start buying their skincare items, too.\n\nSo, Philosophy, I'm definitely a repeat customer.

Past experiences have been pleasant- friendly and helpful staff, and the wine is good. We actually had two of their brands at our wedding reception. Believe me, I'm no connoisseur, I just know what I think tastes good. Anyway...\n\nTwo weekends ago, my friend and fellow yelper Carrie and I attended a murder mystery dinner at the newest Greenhouse Winery location on Pinewood Road. This was our first visit to this new location but certainly not our first murder mystery dinner, which we both love. (The husbands were left home on this occasion.) Our tickets cost $45 each, which included 5 free wine samples, dinner, and the show. This is more than any other show we've been too; most are around $32. The only difference is that they don't include the wine tasting. Since there are several moving parts to this event, I'll break them down for you as best I can:\n\nThe winery: the place is up a long winding road, on top of a hill. It's very nice and in the summer I could see going up there with lunch, playing some bocce or horseshoes and drinking some wine (like rich folk do lol). We were told that they do not make or serve food, but they do have meat and cheese trays you can buy. You are permitted to bring your own food and make a day of it. The day we were there was extremely windy and, being on top of a hill, I could see this being an issue if you planned on being outside. As mentioned, we were permitted 5 free samples of wine, which we of course took full advantage of. Of course, a sample is really like 2 sips, maybe. You could 'buy' additional sips for $1 each or choose to buy wine by the glass or bottle to take into the show with you. So, hey, buy a bottle right...because it's the cheaper option in the long run. They also provided coffee, water, and pop (soda for you non-yinzers).\n\nThe show: Fun and funny as usual. Although both of the winners were at our table and not us. Meh. \n\nThe service: Nearly non-existent. At other locations, they have wait staff coming around to check on your table, take away plates, fill up water, etc. Not here, they had someone come around twice - once to take appetizer plates and once for dinner plates. I had to go back out into the winery area to ask for more water and I was told to please bring my carafe and they would fill it up. Umm, no. Anyway, the real issue laid with the drunks at the table behind us. They were talking loudly, laughing, and just all around being jerks. Everyone on our side of the room was visibly annoyed. One of the guys at our table turned around ask them to quiet down, and the one jerk actually told him \"I will f-n kill you.\" It was terrible. And hey, I'm all for rowdiness...if it suits. This just wasn't the place for some ball-bustin, whiskey shooting, hell of a time. Feel me? They clan of 5 were finally either kicked out or asked to leave, but honestly it was half way through and already such a distraction at that point. I feel that if there were staff around more, they would have gotten kicked out a lot sooner and not cut into my $45 dinner.\n\nSpeaking of dinner. The food: the worst I've had at a murder mystery dinner. They buffet style dinner consisted of breaded chicken (which I like but Carrie didn't have so much luck with), stuffed shells (passed on those), potatoes and tortellini salad. The food was fine, there simply wasn't much selection. I can't really give the winery too much slack for this because it was catered. However, they still should have done their homework on what other locations provide. My biggest grip with this was we've paid $32 at The Lamplighter and they have chicken, fish, roast beef, ham, cole slaw, salad, fresh veggies, etc. So, we really both felt ripped off.\n\nTo sum it up, I would come back in the summer to hang out and have lunch.

It's small, quiet (on most days), and green. I go there when I don't want to deal with crowded parks like Sunset. Actually, I have mostly given up on Sunset and replaced it with Paradise. :) \n\nThe way these people make Paradise out to be is totally not what it really is. I say, check it out for yourself. If you prefer grass and matured trees over the dull gravely desert landscapes found in these newer 'homeless free' parks, or you just want to get away from crowded parks, but still want to enjoy the greenery, then Paradise is the place to go. I have had a lot of peaceful picnics here. Never had a problem with homeless people (who I've barely scene) or drug dealers (who I've NEVER seen, and I've hung out here late at night to have some wine with friends.).

But, hey, guess what?  It works, and there's always something going on.  \n\nThere's plenty of benches and, since we're not prissy and use park grills, plenty of grills to use.  There's a covered area or two that, on the weekends, are usually reserved for parties, but you could call Parks and Rec to reserve them for yourself if you were so inclined.  The park boasts a large playground, exercise route, basketball courts, a rec center and a pool.  It's an older park, and the trees are mature, full and offer plenty of shade in the summer.  Ice cream trucks used to have little ice cream wars trying to get customers to buy their (identical) wares over their competitors (identical) confections and hopefully will once it warms up again.\n\nOf course, Tropicana and McLeod is no longer exactly the BEST neighborhood in town.  The park police patrol the park regularly, oftentimes not bothering to get out of the car but driving through the park on the grass itself.

I'm still in love.\n\nHave used it on five occasions now, and have had a fantastic experience every time.\n\nThe app is free and available for iOS and Android. And it's AWESOME.\n\nIt finds you on the map (you can edit/adjust as necessary), then tells you how far away the nearest cab is. On every occasion, it was less than five minutes. UNHEARD OF!!! It's always at least 15-20 minutes when I call other Toronto taxi companies (I'm looking at you, Beck and Co-op!) so this has been life-altering!! \n\nSo once you see how long the cab would take to reach you, you decide whether to \"hail\" it or not. If you do, you will then be connected with the driver. The map will continue to show both you (a little blue bonhomme) at your location and the cab (a yellow car icon) moving towards you. It's adorable. The time continues to count down and an alert sound is played when the taxi is one minute away, then again when it has actually arrived.\n\nAnd off you go! Once in the cab, you can choose a tip amount (15%, 20%, 25%, etc. options) and watch your little blue man ride the yellow cab on the map all the way to your destination. ADORBS!!! Once payment has happened and you're out of the cab, you can rate your driver (5-star scale). A receipt is emailed to you, and the trip is saved in a log within the app. It's all pretty slick, and very impressive. \n\nYou can easily find promo codes for them online - there are $5 and $10 credit codes right now, some only good for your first ride. The most recent driver gave me some business cards to give to my friends with a $5 code on it too - sweet!\n\nIt's been a while since I've been so jazzed about a new business or service, but I love it when someone finds a way to make my life easier. \n\nThis one is going to change the whole industry.

Here it is: Hailo is the only City-licensed app-based taxi service.

My one irk is when people review something on Yelp outwith its context or usefulness. If you don't believe, or use, complimentary and herbal remedy you may well think Napiers is a bit of hoo-hah and pricey to boot.\n\nBut if you do see the value, and have reaped the benefits, of herbal remedies in the past then Napiers is like a mecca for all things herbal and healing. You can generally find herbal remedies in most places now, like Boots and even the supermarkets, and the other big brand Holland&Barret.\n\nNapiers, however, only really stock their own brand products but they're none the worse for it. They have their own blends of things, so when I went in looking for arnica cream to use on an ITB knee injury (for ligament pain) they suggested a Napiers blend with all sorts of other things AND arnica I hadn't heard of anywhere else. And it really, really worked a treat.\n\nThe shop assistants are very well versed and helpful, and really listen and suggest things that might work for your ailment.

See my lists for details.\n\nBar Zo\u00e9 Karaoke Et Cocktails (etc.) is probably one of the best karaoke bars in Montreal. It does a lot of things really well, nothing really badly, and a few things...surprisingly--and comes on top in almost every respect.\n\nSinging:\n\nZo\u00e9's singing setup is the best I've seen anywhere. Singers (up to two live microphones) have a stage to themselves next to the DJ booth, and can easily read the lyrics from two visible screens. The acoustic is set up smartly with sensitive mics, invisible but powerful monitors and good instrumental tracks. The song selection is serviceable and often includes more than one version of popular tunes. If you've picked out a duet by mistake, the DJ will sing with you, even if he doesn't know the lyrics. He's a trooper.\n\nFor the best conditions in town to absolutely destroy a song, I give Zo\u00e9's five Busted Microphones.\n\nBooze:\n\nThis is Zo\u00e9's weakest point, which means it's merely good.\n\nThe selling point of their bar menu is obviously the cocktails, being in the business name and all. They're tasty, generally sweet items for people who prefer their poison colourful. The full list of available mixed drinks is quite exhaustive and you can expect to find something right for you. The beer, on the other hand, is somewhat disappointing, with a limited selection of somewhat overpriced brands on tap. Still, with such a solid offering, your friends will soon find it in themselves to belt out their best Sinatra.\n\nFor a great variety at the expense of decent cheap beer, Zo\u00e9 receives four Bohemian Rhapsodies.\n\nExtras:\n\nThis is where this place really shines. \n\nLet's agree that Karaoke is a gimmick to sell alcohol to groups who normally would not be inclined to close a bar, let even go to one. Zo\u00e9 recognized this and ran with it. They will gimmick the crap out of you.\n\nBefore the Karaoke starts, the bar doubles as a specialized fondue restaurant (!), and demonstrates a staggering dedication to the concept. The white tablecloths, the reusable towelettes, the wine card, the actually pretty great food and all the details I missed; it's like they're secretly ashamed of being a Karaoke bar. This makes for a mighty fine evening.\n\nThere are some other inspired decisions. The songbooks are actually computers with keyboard screwed into the walls; you can look up songs by title or artist name almost immediately, provided you know what you are looking for. Singers have their back to a giant screen where onlookers can easily read the lyrics and sing along. There is a smallish dance floor. The gambling room is entirely isolated from the main bar. The restrooms are way classier than they have any reason to be.\n\nFor outdoing themselves in any conceivable respect, Zo\u00e9 gets five Awesomes out of a possible five.\n\nAs with any Karaoke bar, your night will largely by defined by the people with you. That being said, once you are ready to surprise your coworkers with that one song you sing really well, you'd be hard pressed to find a better stage than Zo\u00e9's. It's relentless assault of genuine coolness on what is essentially a kitschy activity will win the hearts of even the most stuck-up anti-singing drones.

I know, I know -  you are all shocked! Call me old-fashioned, but having had a few bikes stolen in the past myself, I just didnt want to go that route...not that I wasn't tempted. So I headed out to local bike stores, swallowing my fears about the price. My fears about the price were not unfounded. There appear to be two main types of bike stores south of Davenport: those that are well-priced, but don't offer quality, and those that offer quality, but the bikes are almost *certain* to get stolen, because of the ginormous price tags...(I am not including the stores selling the stolen bikes).\n\nSo I ventured further North, and it wasn't long before I fell in love with a hybrid women's Trek - despite the flowered decals!

Being long in the legs, and short at the waist (sniff, sniff) a bike designed for women makes all the difference, hokey decals aside (I used similar arguments for my mtn bike and my downhill skiis, also of the prerequisite flowers and pretty colours, ugh i have no shame). \n\nSo I forked over the extra dough, and almost two years later, I couldn't be happier. Trek may not be hip, or made in the Netherlands, but I heart my bike, and it has been great. The initial service was good (they encourage you to take the bikes for a spin), and I haven't needed to go back since.\n\nAnd once the warranty is over, you can spray paint the flowers away!", "business_id": "CGpC_L37PBnIbs8TsuBEpA", "stars": 3, "date": "2010-01-07", "useful": 2, "type": "review", "cool": 1}, {"funny": 3, "user_id": "X2uF3C3YBD24xcgKA104Sw", "review_id": "czxrezYRddzWJq6stbDvqw", "text": "Now, if this was a review of the food alone, this would have an extra star, but it's not, but I will say - the food was much much better than the naff service here.

Recently Graeter's Ice Cream, a popular Cincinnati ice cream icon opened up in the renovated Caesar's Palace food court. The company boasts that this is the first location West of the Mississippi River. \n\n The Vegas Strip is a grown up Disney Land. When I am in Disney Land I want to get ice cream. Our original intention was to stop at Ghiradelli in the Linq. Unfortunately this location falls far short on sufficient seating. So, my brother recommended Graeter's Ice Cream in Caesar's Palace. \n\n  Graeter's Ice Cream is incorporated in the Caesar's Palace food court next to Starbuck's. Because of its small size, I regard this more of a Graeter's Express than a full scale ice cream parlor. When I researched the company online, Wikipedia showed a sundry of flavors. However, at this food court location I saw ten signature flavors on the overhead menu. They were black raspberry chocolate chip, caramel gelato, chocolate, mint chocolate chip, dark chocolate gelato, mocha chocolate chip, lemon sorbet, double chocolate chip, vanilla bean, and salted caramel. I could write that it is quantity over quality with an argument that Graeter's specializes in a French pot method of ice cream making that is supposedly so good that they process it two gallons at a time. \n\n Just like Disney Land, prices in many of the businesses throughout the adult Disney Land are ridiculously expensive. For the price of what a couple of scoops cost here, unless your on a diet, it is worth it to go all the way for a sundae. \n\n  I ordered the strawberry shortcake sundae. It was two scoops of black raspberry chocolate chip and mocha chocolate chip ice cream in substitution for vanilla covered with strawberry topping, whipped cream and a cherry served in a paper bowl. The ice cream was delicious. But why don't they offer strawberry ice cream? It is only fitting that a strawberry shortcake sundae would go along good with strawberry or strawberry chip ice cream. Regardless, the sundae was delicious. \n\n  Regarding Graeter's, I  scream that their ice cream is a delicious treat if you are in the center of the Las Vegas Strip.", "business_id": "LgjI2iZlryV0bX5mwSgXEg", "stars": 3, "date": "2015-04-01", "useful": 4, "type": "review", "cool": 5}, {"funny": 6, "user_id": "NwVyki35xOcaxhMzHNtHDQ", "review_id": "faz6NnZaq0x6Y1qpe9_TtQ", "text": "There is something seriously awesome about being on the hunt for a really good pen, then having a lightbulb moment that there actually is a shop in Stockbridge that exists to sell stationary.

The burger which is his own blend of chuck and brisket was done over an open flame grill to a perfect medium rare/medium with a nice char flavor with lettuce, tomatoes, onions and your choice of cheese. Wifey went with the Jalapeno Havarti as suggested by Mr. Jorgenson. We were very pleased with our choices, but would ask for more sauce on the pulled pork and to toast the buns for sandwiches/burgers.\n\nHis business hours vary...He opens at 5 pm, closes between 9 and 10 pm, depending on business, availability of items, and takes two days off a week.\nIf his trailer isn't there, he's off doing a pop-up service at a local business in town.\n\n*The best thing to do before taking the drive out is call to check hours, availability of items and location so you won't be disappointed.

The menu is pretty lean for breakfast; muffin, bagel, or something like a muffin or something like a bagel.\n\nMy friend and I got bagels and cream cheese. Her with coffee and I with earl grey.  The bagel was not really toasted enough and the cream cheese was 2 prepackaged \"PHILADELPHIA\" pouches dropped on my plate.  Jen said the coffee was ok and I suppose I could say the same about my earl grey--simply a tea bag in a mug of hot water.\n\nDespite the subparness of the eats and drinks, there are a few things that are really positive about The Willow House.  Such as:\n\n+++Free Wi-Fi+++\nNot only free, but blazing fast Wi-Fi and no silly password or time limits.\n\n+++Vinyl Digging+++\nTheir is a coat closet filled with 12\" albums covering a good range of musics and qualities POOR to VERY GOOD and maybe some NEAR MINT if you really dig. The price was reasonable too with $1 per one or $6 for an entire crate (50+ LPs)!!!\n\n+++Local Resource+++\nThe local rag is there as well as flyers for DIY shows and even a Crispin Glover speaking event.  This is pretty ordinary, but still always commendable when these types of resources are getting fewer and fewer with big box infiltration.  Not every biz allows free advertising space for DIY artists and musicians.\n\n+++Outdoors***\nRed picnic tables are scattered around in the side lawn of The Willow.  True that in Phoenix, comfortable outside dining time is limited. Near these tables there is also this wall comprised of beautiful metal panels all colorfully weathered, rusted, and corroded.  Perhaps I am biased with my unorthodox rust-belt view of what true beauty is.--But I find it so and i write so and so it is.\n\n***Cats***\nI am a gigantic catfag in every way.  Outside, next to the picnic tables there was a concrete garden bench and under this bench was. EEEEEKKKK!!!  A mussy mess of black and white cat keeping her cool.  She was a very skanky looking cat and I was smitten.  I instantly made her a little song as I sung to her and took photos . I think, \"Dusty Desert Skanky Cat\" was part of the lyrics and it was a tad Pete Seger sounding.  I later learned that that was a momma cat that the employees of The Willow House named Thundercat and there are other cats that climb a tree to bathe in the morning.

I emailed them for a quote and had a well-written, detailed response in my inbox just an hour or so later. \n2. They confirmed with me the day before and morning of my first scheduled service. Life gets hectic and there's nothing better than a reminder (or two) of an upcoming appointment. \n3. They arrived promptly without calling fifty times for directions. We've hired service providers who have called asking for step-by-step instructions for arriving at our home. That's what Google Maps is for. \n4. They asked for clarification. As any teacher, parent or boss would say, it's better to ask and do something right than to not ask and do it wrong. \n5. They got the job done and did it well. In just four hours (keep in mind we have a fairly large house that hasn't been cleaned in, say, 9 weeks), our house sparkled from top and bottom.

It dosn't matter if it's over the phone or in person.  And everyone gives you a different story!\nSo check this out.  We have several accounts.  I have one, hubby has one and we have a joint account. So I closed my account.  They want to start charging $10.00 per mo.  Sorry, I'm not going to pay that.  That's $120.00 per yr.  So I closed it.  Ok, so now I don't have access to this closed account anymore right?   So a few days later, I go to the joint account to pay a bill and to transfer money from the joint account to another bank.  So I didn't see anything pending in the other bank.  hummmm, so I call.  They can't tell me anything, I call the other bank, they say it's not on there in, and give it another day.   Now I'm getting pissed.  So I call Armed forces bank.  Ohhhh some how they took money out of the closed account,  huh?  How the heck did that happen, and I don't have access to that account.  Well bill pay, did it.  Ok, I need $ transferred to that bank, and you guys need to get that $ out of the account it was transferred to.   They said oh after a certain amount of time they system will catch it.  We will do a free transfer to your other account.  You should have it in a few hours.  Ok cool.  So anyway to make the story short.  I was on the phone with them all week.  No one knew anything, no one can see that I had double the $ that was transferred to that account.  I was so annoyed.  Finally, I got a phone call from the bill pay.  I told them I had been on the phone with AFB all week, and they couldn't tell me to call bill pay (your company)  Also come to find out from the bill pay guy.  That on the AFB if you have more than 1 account you have to go in and delete that account!  Ok, I don't freaking work for the bank.

He occasionally makes some of his famous popcorn which is from a real movie theater style popper.  He has nice size tv's in each corner and will always have the game on.  I personally made him a hockey fan during the playoffs.\n\nIf you are tempted, stop in, go for some wings and try a pasta dinner or one of his sandwiches.

On this occasion Kiehl's had sent a reminder the day before to go pick up the lip balm. Now, I like lip balm, of course I do, I'm a girl and I love free and I love Kiehl's, so off I went.

If I were you, I'd be wary of even walking through that front door, because once you claim one of their products as your own, you'll never settle for anything else. And with only one Kiehl's (as far as I know) in all of Toronto, it's a dangerous addiction to have. \n\nSome evidence...\n\nThe \"Supremely Gentle Eye Makeup Remover\" is the only makeup remover that will ever touch my eyes. It's a lotion-based makeup remover, unless some of the grotesque oil-based removers out there that leave your face greasy and necessitate tugging. It's smooth, easy on your delicate eye area and doesn't smell weird. I wear dramatic eye makeup most days and this gets all of it off in a snap.\n\nMore evidence...\n\nThe \"Creme de Corps Soy Milk & Honey Body Polish\" is the only scrub I'll ever use. Once you use this scrub, any other exfoliating scrub will seem too gritty, dry or wimpy for your calluses. This is the real deal - it gives you an unbeatable scrubdown and it smells like honey. Oh, and it has jojoba oil in it, which is essential what the sub-species of Humans  With The Softest Skin On Earth\u2122 swear by. I've tried other scrubs from Aveda, Philosophy, etc. and I always come back to this one because it just gets the job done, pure and simple.\n\nOK fine - a third piece of evidence...\n\nAre you using eye cream yet? And if not, why not? You know you should be, if only to start preventing those pesky signs of aging. The \"Creamy Eye Treatment with Avocado\" has a really unique texture and a small container of it, while a little pricey, will last you forever because it goes on really thick. The only thing that could make it better would be SPF 30. \n\nWhen you visit, make sure Zach's working. You'll be able to spot him because he'll be jamming to Lady Gaga, Britney Spears or Kylie, and he'll rush up to you and say \"Oh my god - have you TRIED the new [fancy, convoluted product name that of course you didn't know about but are like, so ready to try like this very instant] yet??\" You'd think Zach was a descendant of the original founders of Kiehl's back in the 19th century; he just knows everything about Kiehl's and its products to a terrifying degree. \n\nThe store sometimes has special makeover nights and product launches, so get on their mailing list so that you'll get invited to them. Another win about Kiehl's is that they're very generous with their product samples, and some of them are good enough to last you months of sampling. It's nice to be able to try stuff before you buy, especially since they have a pretty massive arsenal of products to offer.", "business_id": "2LwD2kptBJxGrIO7zm9EMQ", "stars": 5, "date": "2009-07-06", "useful": 11, "type": "review", "cool": 7}, {"funny": 7, "user_id": "zo2vscKNvDzXWj7YOrdJVA", "review_id": "zYWzxZJ-ohjdk60-NijeIQ", "text": "I can see what all the fuss is about!\n\nGreat spot for brunch.

I don't think I have ever pulled over so quickly.  \n\nWe had heard rumours of this additional location, but we weren't sure when it was opening.  It turned out that it was only their second day in operation.  The interior was not as homey as the original Mitzi's, with their collection of vintage kitchen tables, but the same prints by a local artist hung on the walls.  The entire layout was more hip, more minimalist, more \"College St.\", with a definite touched-by-an-interior designer feel.\n\nThe menu was brought to us printed out on white paper.  We were used to peering up at the blackboard at Mitzi's for the day's menu, as it changes all the time.  I'm not yet sure if this new Mitzi's will follow the same system, but I can't imagine they wouldn't.  Half the fun is anticipating what amazing combinations and flavours will be available for brunch next weekend.\n\nI ordered the oatmeal buttermilk pancake, with fresh cream, blueberries, pernod custard, and the usual spiced potatoes and garnish fruit.  I would never order pancakes normally, but I decided to be adventurous.  I don't generally enjoy pancakes, and I find them heavy and bland, but the aforementioned description of the dish sounded too good to pass up.  I am so glad I didn't.\n\nI have never enjoyed a meal at Mitzi's more than I did that day.  I always ordered French Toast, or Poached Eggs, or something with lentils and Indian spices, and while they were rave-worthy dishes in the past, they were now put to shame by the oatmeal pancake.  It was so moist, light, and delicious, it barely needed the cream or custard.  That being said, the Pernod custard complimented the fresh blueberries so unbelievably well.  Every bite was perfect!\n\nThe wait-staff was incredibly polite and friendly, and we still received our coffee in eclectic mismatched mugs.  I loved all the flower boxes surrounding the patio.

I was disappointed to see that the Nachos were Chips, Cheese Whiz, Tomatoes, Onions on a plate with a small bowl of Beans, cup of Guacamole, cup of Salsa, and two packages of Sour Cream on the side......what the ___?  Was I suppose to create this thing myself?  Where did it say that on the menu?  I know why they did it.....to save money.  There's less food waste when you do stuff like that, but seriously?\n\nAs a fan of Nachos it was a huge letdown.....plus they didn't taste good at all.  The Chips weren't fresh and the flavors were just strange.....unappealing.\n\nMom enjoyed her Fish & Chips, which were really Fish & Fries.  She liked her Fish and I tried a few Fries...they weren't bad.  Maybe I ordered the wrong item?\n\nOverall, the service was good and since Mom enjoyed her dish I'm giving this place 2 Stars instead of 1.\n\nWill I return?

USW is biggest David we have in the battle against the Goliath of Greed that is Corporate America. \n\nThe USW was founded in the blood of those who toil, those whose fingernails have soot under them, those 146 garment workers who died in the Triangle Shirtwaist Factory Fire of 1911, those whose muscles ache at the end of their day, those who make society function, those who produce, those who forge, smelt, lift, climb, rescue, and nurse the injured and sick back to health. \n\nUnions are imperfect, but without them there would be no rights for those who work, and the few in power who scheme, gamble, downsize, and profit would be unstoppable in their economic campaign of terror.

But numerous polls, from those sponsored by the New York Times to USA Today/Gallup, have shown that these Republicans are wrong, that the public is not with them. Consistently, 60 percent in the polls say they oppose legislation terminating worker rights.\"\n\nThey don't want corporations and they don't want governments to return to the days of the Triangle Shirtwaist Factory, when young women, without a union and without an effective collective voice, labored in a fire trap that eventually killed them. They don't want government to give itself or corporations the unfettered ability to exploit workers again.\"\n\n\"No matter how better educated American workers get. No matter how much more innovative. No matter how much more productive. No matter how many tax dollars the government spends on research and development, if the corporations that benefit move manufacturing overseas, the American workers who paid for it will suffer.\"\n\n\"An ordinary American dreams of a family-supporting job, owning a home, saving enough to pay for a child's college education, helping to build a safe community.

Since we don't spend a ton of time in a hotel room in general, we were happy with our latest choice. Typically, we stay at the nearby Courtyard, but because it was all booked up, we decided to try this Hilton Garden Inn instead. I'd say that it is pretty on par with the other HGI that we've stayed at throughout North America.\n\nFor $95 CAD with AAA discount for a Saturday holiday weekend, the price was great. Some other locations were looking at over $120 CAD/night. Access to the hotel is easy right off of Highway 7 and Commerce Valley Drive. There is a lot of construction going on right now, so be prepared to get stuck between the exit off of Highway 404 and Leslie St. if you're arriving around late afternoon-dinner time. As an alternative, you can head west and turn right down Warden and take the back street to bypass it.\n\nThe parking is plentiful and free, and so is the wifi. You can also have wired access if you prefer to be sitting at a desk. Our room was the basic King Room, and it was very large and spacious (around 375 sq. ft. maybe more). The decor is a bit dated with an ornate headboard in a maple wood, and similar nightstands and armoire. The 32\" flat-screen TV was decent, and nice that it didn't have a delayed response. The window coverings were a floral forest green/ivory color combination; again reflecting an older style.\n\nHowever, the bed was surprisingly comfortable. We had stayed at another HGI in New Jersey, and don't recall the bed being this comfortable. It was slightly firm but mostly soft, but most importantly, when one person moved, the other didn't feel it. Yay for no wiggle! :) You sure won't have any slumber issues because of that! The added convenience of a mini fridge, microwave, coffee maker was nice and they were all clean. Washroom was a good size for 2 people, but the door when opened blocked the entryway and there's no fan. Water pressure was great, though the water was evidently hard, thus making for dry skin.\n\nHousekeeping was a little scatterbrained as we had to tell 3-4 ladies that we did not need housekeeping as we were checking out. Each time we told a different lady, they would go back to each other and start bickering. However, each were sweet in personality. The front desk crew could use a little bit more pep in their step but they were pleasant. Breakfast is not included, and is a la carte starting at $8, and buffet is $16 CAD. With all the nearby eating choices, you're better off eating out.\n\nOverall, we had a pleasant stay, and would gladly return. Good value, easy access off of Highway, and about 20 minutes from Downtown Toronto. If you prefer the quiet, request a 6th floor room that faces the back of the hotel.

That's until they pile even more cheese and pep on top of the pizza right before boxing it up. Looking for a meaning? It means \"bloody well good muthaf**er!.\" That's what the artists were trying to convey. :D \n\n\nSo yeah, this is similar to a Beto's pizza with the unbaked cheese compounding the toppings that are already on it.  \n\nAnother interesting thing about DiCarlo's pizza is that they use provolone instead of mozzarella, and it works exquisitely. The pepperoni is smoked, tender, fresh, and the mushrooms are finely cured. The sauce has a citrusy flavor to me. But that crust...\n\nI could eat that golden, buttery, crispy crust alone, naked. The crust I mean, not me. Well, you know what? I would eat this crust in the nude! It's that good.  The crust was so good, I was thankful for how it extended beyond the pie, again, framing the whole thing and giving me the chance to taste the crust by itself.  \n\nBtw, that cheese was melted perfectly when we got it home, and like a Beto's, you can always pop it in the oven if the unmelted cheese is just too far out for ya. I kind of dig it as is though. \n\nTake Beto's pizza and mash it up with DeMino's in Brookline, and you'll have a DiCarlo's pizza.

For $5.95, this creation easily put any $5 footlong to shame. Every individual ingredient was fresh and of excellent quality. Sandwich breads are baked by Bon Breads. The mushrooms appeared shiitake-less in favor of small pieces of chanterelles and other exotic varieties. Large chunks of avocado were incredibly buttery! I even detected a few large grains of sea salt used as seasoning. A small side of homemade pickles seemed to disappear from my plate while I was distracted by the second half of my sandwich.\n\nTaste is a large space with many tables. The layout, with its colorful, mismatched chairs and staircase in the center of the room, reminds me of Michelle Bernstein's trendy cafe Crumb on Parchment, located in Miami's Design District. Baked goods include croissants (served with homemade pear or tomato jam), coffee cake, and mini fruit pies. I didn't confirm where the pastries are brought in from, but square scones always seem like a Chocolate & Spice signature to me. The market area offers some unique coffees, gourmet condiments, and various items, but doesn't really capture my attention. Beer (PBR) and wine are served on tap, and bottled beers are available in a refrigerated case.

Also, I want to add one thing about the prior reviewer stating that the refreshments at this theatre are cheaper; it's simply not true. Even if there is a certain item that is cheaper, the small sizes of everything they sell are a complete rip off. \n\nYeah, so anyways; Let's start off with the militant old woman that runs this hole of a place. Her friendliness reeks disingenuous as she greets you, and then gets on her walkie-talkie to radio the undercover creeps at this theatre watching your every move. She states to them how many tickets were purchased and for what film. Yes, I feel justified calling these people creeps, because that is exactly what they are, creepy. You are treated like a criminal upon entering this theatre, or maybe they just profile people like me, that look different. Either way, there is no excuse for this place. \n\nSo on to the concession stand were we paid $4 for a pretzel with cheese. Thank God there was cheese because this nasty, huge, tasteless piece of microwaved dough in plastic, tasted horrible. We also bought a medium Pepsi and a small popcorn which all totaled about $11. The amount of soda was that of a can and the popcorn had some weird generic taste to it. The girl working the stand also came off as disingenuous. I just can't stand fake smiles. \n\nSo here is the kicker of it all; I go back out to the concession stand before the movie and ask for a courtesy cup. They charge me 25 cents on top of what we already paid! That's not the kicker though. Are you ready for this? She has the AUDACITY to ask me what the cup was for...? Are you splitting popcorn or your pop? Uhhh? Are you serious! She's lucky I was in a good mood, that's all I can say. I should of ripped her head off verbally. This place has no right to ask such things. None what so ever! Let's move on.\n\nThe theatres are actually very small and that of the 90's. If you sit behind someone then you won't be able to see. There is also a very odd, mild scent of dirty toilets that lingers through the theatres.

What I thought was really hilarious, was the amount of people who had snuck stuff in. You heard all kinds of pop cans and bags opening exactly as the previews started. So it looks as if all their Barney Fife tactics fail in the end.\n\nLast but not least, they have plain clothed people standing around hiding their walkie-talkies when the theatres let out, to ensure no one sneaks into another film. They stare at you, as if they are mentally warding you off.\n\nSo needles to say at this point, this theatre is HORRIBLE. I only recommend going if you are dirt broke and want to see a new release. If you're not broke, go somewhere else and spend the extra 2 dollars; Because this place is not worth it.\n\nP.S. What movie theatre has Pepsi over Coke? That's just un-American.\n\nP.S.S.

The seating area is a waiting area because the bouncers will only let a few people into the dance floor/bar area at a time. So, feeling like fresh meat, we all stood and chatted while we waited to be let into the club. Shots were being served in the waiting area as well as beers, but no mixed drinks...boo. Once we finally were allowed into main area, the music was jumping and so were all the ladies! There were all kinds of women at this club!

The space is more or less unchanged with a few art pieces added as well as a fresh coat of paint. The massive main hall is complete with a large open dance floor which on Friday and Saturday nights is set up for live traditional German music. I don't know about you but I'm always looking for a chance to wear my lederhosen and whoop it up to a good polka.\n\nThe menu is a short list featuring many traditional German dishes and while most think of German food as only sausages and pretzels, they might be surprised by hearty roasted meats, stews and schnitzels. \n\nI've owned a fondue pot for years but not once have ever used it. The idea of eating hot molten cheese sounds amazing but for whatever reason I just have never gotten around to making it. So when I noticed Swiss Cheese Fondue ($15) on the menu, I thought of my orange cast iron pot sitting there collecting dust. So when a ceramic bowl of what looked like seized gravy was delivered, I figured there was something wrong. Asking our server she revealed \"that's how we serve it\", maybe my expectations were higher? \n\nTraditionally made with veal, a schnitzel recipe can also be made with boneless pork loin or chicken breasts pounded into cutlets. Now with the addition of a sour cream sauce makes it a Rahmschnitzel ($18), guess I should have asked for a description before I ordered it. You see I had envisioned a lightly breaded and fried schnitzel with creamy gravy. So when my schnitzel arrived, it was actually pan cooked and not fried like I was hoping for. So I swallowed my bitter pill along with my first bite, fork tender deliciousness. My only wish is that they had not been out of mashed potatoes; something about putting gravy on a baked potato just didn't work for me.\n\nHaus also has a selection of nightly specials which include 2 sides at a great price. If you ever see Schweinehaxen ($19) listed on the specials board, order it. Schweinehaxen is either a roasted pork knuckle or shank that's been cooked until the meat is fall of the bone tender and the skin is crispy and chewy. For the serious pig lover, the skin was cooked so well that it's like eating a piece of lacquered pork candy. Along side I had little dumplings called sp\u00e4tzle and a wonderfully flavorful stewed red cabbage, these both added to the delight of each and every piggy bite.\n\nSitting here writing I can't help but think of the additively porky Schweinehaxen.

The pieces of bread weren't bigger then lining up 3 loonies in a row. \nThe spring rolls were $10 and were 5 rolls cut in half. \nThis food was totally over priced and the only thing you are paying for is their rent. \nThe table tops are chipping and have pieces falling off making the edges rough and sharp that scratch your arms. \nWe asked for our bill and there is a 17% gratuity on it which is the highest I have ever seen and no one informs you of this. Then when we asked for separate cheques we were told no. Then you pay the server and she grabs the money and disappears. The servers didnt clean any used glassware. We ask another server if we could get drinks and are told we should go to the bar. They don't do cash and carry. This being after we have spent $300.00\nI can't say how disappointed I am in attending this establishment . I have worked in the industry for 20 years and totally do not understand how people still come here. \nThe only reason i give 2 stars is because the washrooms were clean and the dj did a great job with a range of different genres of music.\n\nBut they lose stars because of the staffs lack of ability to accommodate the requests of their guests, the lack of food selection and we had our side plates, cutlery and use glassware sit on the table until we left at the end of the night. 30 glasses and empty wine and beer bottles. A big no no. You never want your guests being reminded how much they have been drinking and neglected.\nI think this place should change their name from YOLO -You only live once to YOGO - you'll only go once", "business_id": "D2fgCYUIpHkUJS7mO9olNQ", "stars": 2, "date": "2015-03-22", "useful": 1, "type": "review", "cool": 0}, {"funny": 3, "user_id": "lUXifKGBbbRUNxaPnuekXw", "review_id": "BYz4ZT-8kdvzruFnaTAbog", "text": "Ahhhh Kmart , you have not changed since I was a rambunctious little 5th grader hiding in clothing racks in the Roanoke Rapid's , NC Kmart store . \n\nI suppose there really isn't a need for a new look since there doesn't seem to be a lot of traffic in this location .

Time to break the decade-long suspense:  \"Strap it on, Darlin', we're headin' to the Roost!\"\n\nSomewhere back in the mists of architectural time, some cinder-block builder wandered the state, stacking block, carrying hod, and built a whole bunch of bunkers.  I mean bars.  Each one situated at a crossroad, each angled to face, exactly, that crossroad.  Genius?  Or merely a stab at defying the soul-crushing monotony that is masonry?\n\nNo matter, the Roost is bunker on the outside, 1950's rumpus room on the inside.  Six guys sitting on one side of the bar, doing the round-robin smoking outside routine, like watching birds on the feeder, taking their turns.  Younger bartender, full of charm if not grace.  Old coot at the corner of the bar.  (Another old coot, as I was there, too.)  Each tavern comes with that one guy, who does the odd fix-em-up work around the joint for a couple free snorts.  This was that guy.  I wanted to ask him SO many things: How the years impartially grind you down, like a water-driven millstone, until you're nothing but bone-dust; how the half-century of guzzling Old Overholt leaves you literally perforated and yet you continue to spend your days filtering hootch through your liver; how in the end time crushes us all, rich or poor, farmer or king.  Instead, I nodded and grunted, which is all you should ever do, your first time at the Roost.  Which may be my last time at the Roost.\n\nHere's why this place gets four stars:  You know it ain't elegant.  Hell, it really ain't even that civilized.  But what you want is a shot?  A beer?  Maybe some remote chance at illicit romance, whether inter- or intra-species?  This is your place.  They don't pretend.  On any level.  They know what you want.  Cheap drunk.  Dark, hence the bunker.  No hassles.  This is the kind of place where, if you were willing to look closely enough and had a keen eye, you might see how the edge of the bar had been diminished, ever so slightly, warn down by three generations of beer guts.  Now that is something.  Huh?  Yeah, at least there's that.\n\n\"Always be drunk.\nThat's it!\nThe great imperative!\nIn order not to feel\nTime's horrid fardel\nbruise your shoulders,\ngrinding you into the earth,\nGet drunk and stay that way.\nOn what?\nOn wine, poetry, virtue, whatever.\nBut get drunk.\nAnd if you sometimes happen to wake up\non the porches of a palace,\nin the green grass of a ditch,\nin the dismal loneliness of your own room,\nyour drunkenness gone or disappearing,\nask the wind,\nthe wave,\nthe star,\nthe bird,\nthe clock,\nask everything that flees,\neverything that groans\nor rolls\nor sings,\neverything that speaks,\nask what time it is;\nand the wind,\nthe wave,\nthe star,\nthe bird,\nthe clock\nwill answer you:\n\"Time to get drunk!\nDon't be martyred slaves of Time,\nGet drunk!\nStay drunk!\nOn wine, virtue, poetry, whatever!\"\n\n -- \"Big Chuck\"  Baudelaire", "business_id": "FmmCFyM2e8tOn6drBWzyuQ", "stars": 4, "date": "2013-02-23", "useful": 4, "type": "review", "cool": 2}, {"funny": 5, "user_id": "Zl1fJNTzNULZiqBRShxUYA", "review_id": "zNBRXdj5Z1wQvkga1kZKTQ", "text": "I'm starting to feel bad that I'm getting all this First to Review credit for Cleveland landmarks.  If you've ever spent much time with Clevelanders, you know that they're a generous, proud, and humble bunch.  Those last two adjectives, \"proud\" and \"humble,\" might seem contradictory, but people from Cleveland are rightly proud of the sense of community that exists in the city itself.  For all the popular-culture and economic abuse Cleveland has taken over the years, the people still very much love their city.  Not only the idea of their city, but the city itself.  They're humble too; you generally won't hear them spouting off about their superiority in any field--except maybe sports, but that's also conflicted.  \n\nCleveland's humbleness, though, can border on neurosis, as the city definitely has an inferiority complex when it comes to other \"great cities\" in the Midwest, whatever that means.  The city is all too willing to spend way too much public money on stuff that doesn't really matter, like Browns Stadium, when things that do matter, like public schools, are falling apart.\n\nThe Veterans Memorial Bridge, known locally as the Detroit-Superior Bridge, exemplifies a lot of the qualities of Clevelanders themselves.  It's not the biggest, flashiest, most well known bridge.  During the day, it's not terribly beautiful.  But it gets the job done, and there's something downright enjoyable about driving and walking across the bridge, especially if you're going from the Near West Side to Downtown.  The court building on the eastern edge of the Cuyahoga River takes away slightly from the view of the Terminal Tower from the bridge (the court building was constructed in 2000), but it's still nice looking at Cleveland's modest skyline.\n\nAt night, the bridge is absolutely gorgeous.  When I lived in Cleveland, we sometimes referred to the Detroit-Superior Bridge as the Blue Bridge because it was lit blue at night (and in the opening to The Drew Carey Show).\n\nThis bridge is the only place in my life I've ever received a moving violation (speeding), which I successfully fought in court.  I also used to think it was funny that the bridge was called the Detroit-Superior Bridge, as it seemed to suggest that Clevelanders thought Detroit was a superior city to Cleveland.  In fact, the common nickname refers to Detroit and Superior Avenues, the names of the streets that lead to the bridge on either side.  Superior Avenue is named after Lake Superior (I believe all five Great Lakes have streets named after them downtown).  For a time, I mistakenly believed that Detroit Avenue led directly to a westbound highway that ran to Detroit, Michigan.\n\nStill, it is funny that one of Cleveland's most visible landmarks is partially named after another city.", "business_id": "HhOMGHcKBAeSw-z6jCKl1g", "stars": 4, "date": "2009-06-07", "useful": 5, "type": "review", "cool": 7}, {"funny": 5, "user_id": "hy4uEHgITEfzxrXzyDhCRg", "review_id": "gEmSNoMRWS7fbjaProrx0A", "text": "Great historic bridge.

I like my Asian restaurants a little more down and dirty authentic. With that in mind I decided I would get just one roll and since it was a cold rainy day a bowl of soup was in order. \n\nThe Sexy Salad Summer Roll with its smoked salmon, tiger shrimp and California greens rolled up in rice paper was the obvious choice for me and would be a testament to how fresh their fish was. The sauce served along side had a fiery tastiness that only added to the \"sexy' in this spring roll. \n\nAs for the soup I went with the Tom Yum Goong which is typically a favorite for me but here it fell flat. The menu description read that it contained tiger shrimp, lemongrass, galangal, lime leaves, mushrooms, chili and lemon juice. Yet as I dove into the soup I discovered sweet cherry tomato halves which caused the soup to have an overall light sweet taste to it not at all spicy like the little chili pepper symbol next to the menu description boasted. Disappointed but still hungry I continued to slurp it up finding a plethora of seasonings hiding out at the bottom of the bowl.

There's lots of fake foods and cooking supplies to encourage your mini chef to get creative. While my little one is too small for the slides and wooden play structures, she does enjoy the swing on one of them, and they are well-designed. She can spend close to two hours crawling around on the immaculate, clean carpet and exploring the toys available to play with on the floor. The large game that is like a rollercoaster with plastic balls rolling around it is definitely a favorite! She also likes the dollhouse, but only with me right by her side to make sure other children don't shut her fingers in the door. For parents with children who can play more independently, there's a few very comfy couches and plenty of tables for sitting. I'm even able to relax in a beanbag chair on the floor with my daughter close by.\n\nIt's never been crowded when I've visited, which is great for us, but I hope more families will discover and support this charming local business!

Our first visit was only $5 after claiming an offer on The Giggle Box's Facebook page, while the regular rate is $10 ($8 per additional sibling) for all day open play. Sundays are reserved for parties, so open play is offered Monday through Saturday from 10am-6pm. They are also running a Groupon offer this week for an excellent deal on play passes.

Everything is new, clean, and cute in The Giggle Box.  I noticed the staff walking around and picking up items and cleaning things while I was there.  It's always nice to know they are doing upkeep on the play floor throughout the day.  They also have a ton of seating options like over-stuffed sofas, bean bags, and tables/chairs everywhere.  This is a big plus because many of these places do not have nearly enough seating for the adults. \n\nAll of the toys here are high quality as well.  The CedarWorks play apparatuses have fun climbing walls, slides, swings, bridges, and even a pirate look out area.  There are also CedarWorks play houses to go in and set up house.

There is also one of those little roller coaster cars, which is always a big hit with my little one.  \n\nMy only complaint would be that there seemed to be a lot of extra open space.  This is nice for the kids to run around, but it also created a sort of unused area feel.  A few more toys like cars to sit and ride in or perhaps a few more Little Tyke style play houses like tree-houses or castles or the like would be nice.  The one main playhouse when we were there was always full of kids who wouldn't let my daughter play inside because she was too little.  The kids were total bullies and weren't sharing the house with anyone, which isn't the staff's fault (Hello, bad parents!!!), but perhaps could be remedied with another 1 or 2 playhouses which would create more play places for the kiddos.\n\nIf this was closer to my house, I think I would be the duchess in no time at all!

All classes are a little different because of the different instructors and song choices but they all use popular dance music and incorporate both cardio and strength training. \n\nThe reason I LOVE this location is... \n1. Most of the instructors are VERY good and have a lot of energy. \n2. The classes are always full which is great to bring up your energy if you are tired. \n3. The space is large enough that there is always enough space to move! \n4. VERY CLEAN \n5. The schedule is awesome-they offer 35 classes a week! (I love the 5:45 am and the 5:45 pm classes!) \n6. Great price! Unlimited Jazzercise for $39/month!! \n\nJust check it out and I know you will have fun!", "business_id": "HUk8iwcUWvUepkVDKL5RBw", "stars": 5, "date": "2009-02-13", "useful": 5, "type": "review", "cool": 4}, {"funny": 3, "user_id": "WXlxViTwXHPBvhioljN9PQ", "review_id": "Db90FhiUqutLfJYxHwN8ZA", "text": "I was in the Broadview/Danforth area so I decided to grab lunch at The Caribbean Dutchpot.\n\nThe restaurant is small and cozy with only a few tables for seating.

I'm afraid I was away from communication due to my vacation and subsequent imprisonment.  It was all to do with a misunderstanding between myself and a young lady, who happened to be the preferred 'woman of the night' of the captain of the merchant ship on which I had booked passage to The Gambia.  A simple vacation turned into a ghastly experience--my saving grace was the little mute cabin boy who bailed me out of that African gaol with no more than a wink and a quart of whiskey.  Thank the Queen of England that that unpleasantness was over with!\n\nGetting on with the review; I dined at Loire the other night.  Now, I don't expect every single dining experience to mirror the service I received during my time in the east; the Oberon, the Taj, the Orient, all designed to make one feel as an honoured guest, with one servant to fill the water, one to take the order, one to push in my chair and one to fetch me a selection of fine cigars from around the world.  Service to me is a boy offering to get me a taxi, make reservations, having an enemy 'taken care of'.  But alas, those days have passed us by.  The fellows at Loire have taken that one step further!  During my luncheon there we were amazed at the business of the room and the lack of servers.  One waiter for the whole bloody room?  The owner sweately opening bottles of wine for disgruntled suits?  What has dining come to?\n\nBut we must be forgiving, I always say, perhaps this is their first restaurant, perhaps they are french, so we went again. \n\nThis time for dinner, it was, if anything, worse.  On a Wednesday night a full room was being served by the same two, and while professional, (and the food quite good) we felt that the servers wanted nothing more than to move on to the next table.  Never before have I had to pour my own water and wine! An Outrage I say!  I tried to remind them who I was, but astoundingly they had never heard the moniker \"Horace B. Mayweather\" and proceeded to scoff.  Yes.  Scoff.  \n\nSo, friends, please find a restaurant which cares about its service (see my other reviews for examples) and give this one a wide berth.\n\nI am off to take the orient express (or what is left of it) to Tehran which, I understand is no longer under British control, for a relaxing holiday.  I am just waiting on my rail confirmations and a letter from my doctor attesting to my alcoholism and therefore allowing me to drink in this 'dry' country. \n\nCheerio!\n\nHM", "business_id": "JFfZDmNAoa_MHG16K2BY6A", "stars": 1, "date": "2009-05-15", "useful": 2, "type": "review", "cool": 1}, {"funny": 3, "user_id": "-_vcdcTeTYp70lNsHrHljA", "review_id": "tZhHntPG77AvPKT_bQDPmA", "text": "Rand has pulled me into his buffet madness!  \n\nI plugged in the address on my GPS and off I went.

There was plenty, don't get me wrong, but nicely presented and very fresh.  They had all the standard fare, fried rice, chow mein, BBQ chicken, spring rolls and won tons. The spring rolls were a bit greasy but everything else was good. Nicely cooked string beans and Egg Foo Young were probably my favorites as well as the fried rice.  They also had a lovely fruit buffet with fresh strawberries and watermelon.  A nice array of sweet treats was also layed out.  My particular favorite was a tiny cream puff that was fresh and soft with a hint of lemon.  \n\nThere were only a handful of diners when we were there.  The buffet area was kept neat and clean.  The dining room is large with beautiful chandaliers and the ceiling is very interesting.  I'm not sure how to describe it but I thought it was nice and a notch above most buffet places.

There's two major hat tips i'll give here, the first being for the easy peasy online ordering system and the second being the aforementioned late night kudos... but it generally stops there.\n\nAnd don't get me wrong... the food was ok. Not great, not \"i'd ever order this at an earlier hour\", but if I found myself in a similar 11pm pickle, i'd probably give it another go but it definitely won't make the regular rotation.\n\nHere's the quick run down:\n\nThe pad thai was decent. A good portion size with lots of prawns. The noodles were really... sticky(?) though? And they turned into a big block of noodle rather quickly. But of the dishes, I'd do this one again.\n\nI'd pass on the veggie tempura. The only saving grace is it's a CRAZY huge portion for the \u00a33.50... SO MUCH FRIED THINGS! But I was expecting a light batter and this came with a full blown, heavy arse onion ring style batter. It was heavy and greasy and I made it through about 3 pieces before I felt a bit off. I threw most of it away.\n\nSame to the spring rolls - decent portion size for what you pay but they felt like the frozen spring rolls you buy at the shop. They were rather forgettable.\n\nI think next time, i'd keep a closer eye on what people before me have ordered and go with that but my current consensus?

My current insurance company/lender (USAA) offers a \"car buying service\" that is designed to save you money on a new car purchase, and so after several failures at other dealerships I decided to give this option a try. I trust this company, and in turn, I trusted that the dealership they were affiliated with would likely be my best bet, which led me to Chapman Mitsubishi (aka Bell Road Mitsubishi) in a search for a new Evo. I was supposed to be able to purchase the car for $100 under invoice, a pretty good deal, and so when I pulled up and they had maybe 20 cars on the lot, I got one of those bad gut feelings. I had spoken to the liaison given to me by USAA's website, and expected the process to go smoothly, so I ignored it, and I went in to find him. After requesting him by name, the receptionist called him and I heard him answer in the back of the showroom, and immediately he tried to pawn us off on someone else. That person was unavailable, so he walked over with another guy who he did end up pawning us off on. They had me drive over to their Hyundai dealership so that my trade-in could be appraised, which is where the nightmare truly began. It took about 20 minutes for the used car manager to come look at my vehicle to begin with, which was totally unnecessary as this place was completely dead. Then after our short drive to ensure that my car was in perfectly functional condition, I was told to have a seat while this guy (who another employee claimed was 'the best in the business') put some numbers together. While I waited, I was then informed that because they didn't have the model I was looking for in-stock, that I wouldn't be getting the deal I was quoted online...then my salesman claimed he didn't know where they'd be getting the car from. I already did my research before going there, I knew exactly which dealership's stock they'd be pulling it from, so that was an outright lie. After waiting for over an hour, the salesman (read: scam artist) comes back with an offer for my trade. Now, before I go any further, let me make it very clear that I fully realize I will be getting bent over any time I try to trade in a used car, that's their job, and that's just how the industry works. However, in this case, the guy has the nerve to offer me $8k for a car that books anywhere between $22 - $33k. I waited for Ashton Kutcher and his camera crew to bust out from the employee lounge or wherever they set up their control room, but much to my surprise, I actually wasn't on an episode of Punk'd. That was really what they tried to offer me for my car. Now, I'd been lowballed on these offers before...I've been offered anywhere from $14.5, to $18, to $23k, but $8,000?!?! This was beyond insulting, and after waiting for over an hour to be insulted like this it was clearly time to walk out. I will never go back to this dealership, and I'd strongly encourage anyone who's considering buying a car from these shady scumbags to go elsewhere if you value customer service and being treated with respect.", "business_id": "FR-i4EftmC3ENZs0KxrxAg", "stars": 1, "date": "2009-12-10", "useful": 4, "type": "review", "cool": 0}, {"funny": 3, "user_id": "WgBoWF5e63SsqJlpbOxOzA", "review_id": "1OLbdBqc8L20UAiVgud-mQ", "text": "THE POOL DECK IS HEATED, the pool itself is also very warm, quite large, and has a slide!

I had just finished some shopping at South Park Mall with the sig-o and decided to see what eating places were near so we could have an early dinner and avoid the Saturday night crowds. The first problem with this place is finding it since it is located in the rear of a shopping complex. I really think they should send their scantily clothed hostesses to traipse  about in the parking lot to make this place easier to find. I am sure this is a gimmick they have for this certain restaurant but being a Friend of Dorothy I was immune to it. I am not lobbying to dress your hostesses like a Presbyterian preacher's wife but use some tact. Since it was around 4:30 pm, business was light and we were readily seated. The place has that dark wood and friendly tavern feel. Our waiter was mostly attentive but had the personality of a throw pillow. I am sure he wasn't at all pleased to have to service the large group of people next to us. I worked in food service for four years and no matter what kind of night you are having you have to fake it sometimes. \n\nWe ordered the BBQ chicken chips as an appetizer which came out pretty fast. The appetizer was pretty good and the saving grace of our entire meal. Still nothing spectacular. The sig-o ordered the spicy shrimp stuffed baguette. The shrimp were cooked to the consistency of the rubber balls you get out of the quarter machine at the local Wal-Mart. The spicy flavor had soaked into the bread instead of staying on the shrimp. The fries accompanying the baguette were very good. I ordered the penne del rey (penne, Alfredo, peppers, snow peas, mushrooms and squash). Don' let the name fool you however, there is nothing from the sea in this dish. I knew this of course before ordering it so this is just a warning not a complaint. The veggies in the dish were woefully undercooked. The sauce was just OK but nothing that couldn't be replicated at your local Fazoli's. We weren't adventurous enough to get dessert and it's not like our waiter offered it anyway. After having two sub par experiences in Charlotte from the local places we may have to hit up some chains. I regret not getting a steak since this is what they are known for.

Watching the not-so-slightly awkward teenage males bust a move folk style is particularly endearing.  :-)\n\nDrinks: If you're eating in the banquet hall, try the anise soda.  If you're getting a gyro outside, try the lemonade.  (Also, don't forget about the fresh cut Greek feta fries...) \n\nDesserts: IMO, the pastries are the best part of the Greek Food Fest.  I've tried most, but not all of them (I'm working on that, though...), and they've all been scrumptious.  My favorite is the galaktabourenko (the cream filled filo pastry).  I just tried a baklava sundae last night, and it was amazing--I'm definitely planning to stop by for another (and more pastries...) before the festival wraps up!\n\nThe people who volunteer for the event are super-friendly, so don't hesitate to ask them questions if you're confused.

Once in the Spring (around May) and once in the Fall (around September). I'm so sad I only went to the Greek Festival my last year in Pittsburgh. This is  a great place just to mingle with the local community. Everyone is extremely friendly and you get a lot of families, college students, and individuals of all ages. \n\nThe food is home-cooked and delicious. They sell more well-known Greek items outside the church such as gyros, fish sandwiches, fries, and Loukoumades. The gyros are huge and stuffed for only $8. Lots of gyro meat, tzatziki, lettuce, tomato, and onion.\n\nIf you venture inside the Church, you can try more of the homemade traditional Greek dishes. In the first room, you can line up for takeout if you're in a hurry. Venturing deeper into the church will lead you to a large dining hall with ample seating. Here, you will find buffet bars with manned by servers in a setup similar to a high school cafeteria. Lines are long and tables are crowded, but you can usually find a place to sit if you don't mind mingling with a few strangers. My favorite is the dessert bar which sells ten different delicious Greek desserts, most I've never heard of.\n\nHere is what I remember getting:\nPasta Flora - Greek lattice tart with strawberry filling. Very delicious buttery tart. I remember this being very sweet. Not as sweet as a baklava though. They give you a huge slice for only $1.75. \nGreek Roast Chicken - not very memorable and nothing too special, but I remember this being juicy\nMoussaka - Very creamy and rich. The serving lady gave me an extra big piece for some reason.\nRice pilaf - I think it's probably the butter, but the rice was very addicting. After I finished my own, I finished the leftovers on everyone else's plates.\n\nI haven't tried it, but they also sell baklava sundaes outside the large dining hall. Not a good place to go if you're on a diet, but definite must-go if you want delicious homemade (which means they're not stingy on the butter) Greek food.", "business_id": "G-U-nhG9V4VTHEiLhXbTHw", "stars": 4, "date": "2014-05-01", "useful": 9, "type": "review", "cool": 8}, {"funny": 10, "user_id": "DYqujEDnSMgwL7sFTRSv8w", "review_id": "merhX0qyNdA6QSdVsc1YPg", "text": "Of the many church festivals one can pick from at different times of the year in Pittsburgh area, this is one of the best.

Baklava,  fried dough with cinnamon (which has a Greek name I've forgotten) and fresh squeezed lemonade and soft drinks (Diet Coke for the calorie conscious).\n\nExpect long lines with a short wait,  but these should be viewed as testimony to the popularity of the event.  The line, serving, paying and seating works with assembly line efficiency.  The tent covered seated areas offer refuge rain or shine.  Portions are huge so bring a friend to share, plan a long run for after or practice screaming \"you lie\" to the bathroom scale later on.\n\nThe location between the two universities is optimal.  You can find parking at either or the museums and plan to make a day seeing other sites, or play a little hooky if you work or study nearby.  It always enjoyable to see, and especially smell, lamb being cooked on a spit.  Lots of people to mingle with,  but if you want solitude, get carry out to take elsewhere.\n\nI highly recommend taking this in!!  There are a few days left this year.  Sumo wrestlers welcome!

I absolutely loved this race! Having completed over 20 half marathons since last summer, this was my first time returning to my neck of the woods in Western PA to finally run a race...and I'm so glad I did!\n\nRace expo: Held at the Lawrence Convention Center downtown, near the start of the race and within walking distance of my hotel. Yes, hotels in the city god-awful expensive during this weekend of 30,000 runners, but it's worth it if you don't have to drive anywhere on race day while dealing with road closures and parking issues. Anyway, the expo included the standard packet, t-shirt and bad pickup with numerous vendors all over the place. Since it was the last hour, it didn't take very long to get in and out before heading down the street for dinner.\n\nRace morning: Show up early to find your respective starting corral, which could be many blocks apart downtown. Also, so many streets are blocked off (literally fenced off), making moving to different course viewing area rather difficult for supporters and spectators. Find a good spot and be flexible when negotiating between the starting line and finish line.\n\nRace: Awesome tour of the city! Starting downtown and then moving through the Strip District, North Shore, Station Square, Southside and then back to the city, crossing five bridges along the way. The course is not extremely difficult with a couple of gradual hills until you reach the last two miles and have to make the long, slow climb across the bridge and around Duquesne hill. Some runners complain more than others about the end of the course, but having done more challenging courses in the past, I didn't think it was the end of the world from a difficulty perspective. More like just bad timing after already completing 11 up and down miles up until that point. Oh, but the best part? The last mile is all down hill, making for a fast finish (my second fastest Half to date, somehow).\n\nThrow in a ton of spectators cheering during most parts of the course, excellent course support by hundreds of volunteers, a beautiful finisher's medal, Eat N Park sugar cookies (Yes!) and fun finisher's party at Point State Park and I would invite any long-distance runner to easily add this as part of their annual racing schedule.

Normally this would be a sick joke to me but because it was the day of the Marathon...it was my current reality. You see about 12 months prior I had this crazy idea, I figured, 13ish miles was fun..how bad could twice that amount be? I was about to find out.\n\nSo there I am, in the dark, rolling out of bed slowly. This was going to be a long day I figured, not to mention this was something I had been training for, for quite some time..race jitters were there aplenty only to be stifled briefly by the amount of water I was guzzling. \n\nMorning stretches were a must as to hopefully help my now war torn body cope with the beating it was about to take, one step on the pavement at a time. \n\n7:00 am\nIt was a bit before 7:00 am now, time to begin walking down. (Luckily for me, I live close to downtown so I wouldn't have to brave the horrid traffic that the out of town race enthusiasts had created)\n\n7:20 am\nI arrive at the scene. A giant mob of people are around me. I make my way into my corral. Originally it had been my idea to try and sneak into a better corral closer to the start line but this year they checked your race bib at each corral entrance. Nice job Pittsburgh Marathon Volunteers, you kept my sneakiness at bay...this time...this time!  I make my way to the front of my corral because you figure the less energy used to run around 1000's of people, the more energy you will have later. \n\n7:30 am\nPost anthem and announcement, the roar of the gun goes off and the race begins...for the 1st corral's that is. The anxiety is building up at this point. Hopping in place, doesn't seem to be helping the matter. The line of volunteers dividing the corrals begins to direct us to move forward, I honestly can say I had never felt more like cattle in all my life. Anyways, we moo-ve to the start line.\n\n7:40ish am\nAnd were are off. I press the play button on my shuffle for music...this is going to be a long trip. I being me, try and stay ahead of the mob behind me, feeling pumped from the song by the band Blur blaring through my headphones I unknowingly am running at a sub 5:30 pace...this is not good...not good at all. I figure at this point, I better actually use my pace watch and not just use it as a paper weight on my wrist, so I do. \n\nMile 1 \nSo many people, still in awe at the turnout and the fact that I am about to run my body into the ground like an idiot.\n\nMile 2-6\nI finally have my pace going steady which is great. I had a nice chat with a friend of mine along the way. He luckily was running the relay, I should have taken notes...but I didn't and instead am running the full. Running through my stomping ground is quite motivational. Normally I run not to get mugged on the North Side, this time it's a bit different...I don't have my wallet. \n\nMile 6-11\nI am able to cross into West End Village and start heading down East Carson St. I chug water like it's my job at every station just to make sure I don't regret not doing later. I see friends yelling my name along the way, it's rather nice. As I run down East Carson St. something occurs to me...I have been drinking a lot of water. In a typical situation one would just use the restroom, but seeing that I had made a couple bets on my finishing time, any delays would have me paying people in cases of beer..and this was not acceptable. (Did I mention that I am idiot?) So as to your guess, I do what one would not want, I pee down my leg. \n\nMile 12\nHoly Mother of Mary.....Oakland apparently has a hill...and it's a big one not to mention the Sun decides that today is the day it will scorch the earth with it's unrelenting rays as if it had just had it's car keyed. That's when it hits me. Why the crap don't I have a better hobby? Maybe collecting stamps would be better?\n\nMile 13\nPeed myself again.\n\nMile 14-20\nI am somewhere in Shadyside I think. Personally I don't care anymore. Location is not important, I have been running for miles up a damn hill and I can't still quite justify why this was a good idea. The sun has been make me it's female dog for quite some time now. I flash back in my head to a statement my girlfriend had made saying that this would be over before I knew it and it would go oh so quick. This is also the point where I realized she apparently enjoys sitting in a throne of lies....this sucks... \n\nMile 20.5\nAt this point I am thinking, oh wow..this is awful, the only motivation keeping me going is the bad music along the way. I need to get away from them..that's all I know. I only stop running briefly to then have someone yell to me, \"IT'S ALL DOWNHILL AT MILE 21!\"..... I remember thinking...I don't care if mile 21 is a cliff we all drop off...I don't want to keep going... but alas..somehow I do.\n\nTo be continued....", "business_id": "QG17_qiD59P2ljs2hYMgeA", "stars": 3, "date": "2012-06-13", "useful": 3, "type": "review", "cool": 2}, {"funny": 7, "user_id": "NAZzgDkNIL_DpHg6xu9APQ", "review_id": "iYKkUlXccZENPCTrJE5rPw", "text": "It is just a great event!

Minimalist.  Quaint.  Delicious.  \"Deconstructed\".  \n\nAll of these words apply to Zocalo, yet I'm at a loss to find words appropriate to really describe this little resto at Bloor & Symington.\n\n\"Fabulous\" is perhaps most apt, maybe even \"peerless\", with a perfect union of venue, vibe, food, drink, and the people behind it all.  Zocalo really is one of those spots foodies must visit, even when terms like \"must visit\" are bandied about most frivolously by reviewers all the time; I'm guilty of it myself.  No hyperbole here, though!  Zocalo is the real deal.  If you have yet to visit, push them to the top of your list.\n\nFeaturing \"broken sandwich\" plates perfect for sharing, they're all about fresh, seasonal, local ingredients, often vegetarian (but often not).  When \"not\", the dearly departed animals are of the \"happy\" variety: free range, organic, and the like.  Co-owner Paul seems particularly pleased with this, and he should be -- while free range is all the rage these days, I didn't actually see it bragged about on the menu.  Quality is just a matter of course at Zocalo, not pride, which is refreshing.  They are who they are, simple as that, even if at times I felt as though they might even be a bit... bashful(?) regarding their obvious excellence.\n\nSo, how about some recommendations:\n\n*  Splurge on as many add-ons as you can afford (easy, as the prices are curiously reasonable).  Half a sausage here, a side salad with your soup there, or maybe a poached egg with your sandwich (which is actually two poached eggs, for a great little secret).  For an inspired combo, get their seasonal soup with salad and poached egg, and note that it's a big mess of meticulously arranged food for a mere $13.\n\n*  Yes, the toutiere sausage on the fall menu is great.  Yes, that's clove you taste.  Yes, it goes splendidly with their cauliflower hummus and its hint of anise.\n\n*  Their coffee is awesome.  A double Americano rivals any I've had (and I've been having a lot lately), and serves as the perfect bookend to a perfect meal (start, finish, or both!).  My first was served by Heather, the other co-owner, and it was pleasing watching the obvious care with which she created it -- barista skills, yes!\n\n*  When you learn what their daily cheese special is, order it; or, if you're feeling frisky, ask what the backup cheese is for when they (inevitably?) run out:  order it, too.  It (or they) will come with some of the best candied almonds you'll ever eat.\n\n*  Don't come if you're famished.  Service takes its time, so if you're prone to panic attacks when waiting longer than 15 minutes, have a nibble before hand.  The wait is more than worth it (even if you require meds to cope).\n\nAnd now for a little inside scoop:\n\nWhile their patio wasn't ready this year, it's all good to go for next.  So take this little tip: watch the calendar come Spring and call ahead to learn when it'll be open.  Be amongst the first to celebrate its reveal!  I know who's patio I'll be frequenting, that's for sure!\n\nTo say I was blown away by Zocalo would be an understatement.  This is what food is all about.

With a small menu it gives them the ability to focus more on ingredients, most importantly... the rice. Traditionally fried rice is made with left over rice as it was a way for poor families to maximize their food rather than waste it, but don't worry. Angel's is not using leftovers (how could they when they only make fried rice?). They use fresh Basmati which is a longer grain found pretty commonly in Middle Eastern food, gives it a nice bite!\n\nInterestingly they combine the common American Chinese dishes (what you find at Panda and Chinese buffets) and put their own spin to it keep a hint of authenticity.

This place saved my life when I was a stay-at-home mom of two toddlers. Yes, the rec centre in the hood was free and had aerobic classes 3 mornings a week with $2 babysitting by a 90something pre-corpse named Alma. One summer day, our favourite aerobic instructor invited all the rec centre hoes to the Mayfair for a complimentary spin class, we were all sold : Classes all day, showers with a whirlpool and steam room, every day, 2-hour day care with organized activities for a monthly fee (way cheaper than preschool) AND you could use it more than once day and that we did. Mornings were fitness and afternoons were cocktail hour because they even have a full service bar/restaurant. YOU CAN DRINK BEER WHILE YOUR CHILDREN  TAKE SWIMMING LESSONS, I REPEAT: YOU CAN DRINK BEER WHILE YOUR CHILDREN TAKE SWIMMING LESSONS. It is awesome.\n\nSometimes when I tell local people what gym I go to, I get an eye roll. The Mayfair Lakeshore has a reputation in the east hoods that I just want to clear up some of the myths:\n\n1. IT'S SO EXPENSIVE! Grow up. I am poorer than Cowboy Jesus and I suck up the cost. The monthly basic fee is around $120 which seems steep compared to that Russian mafia run chain gym you reluctantly joined after buying a Groupon that you actually never go to because the machines are literally covered in douche juice. The Mayfair is actually a LIFESTYLE, not a gym per se. You go there to \"workout \"while you peripherally stalk your crush. And because you actually make friends with other members, your wing man goes on the treadmill beside said crush and finds out he is single and in the time it takes you to train for a 10k  (6-8 weeks) you are over it and taking personal training sessions from the cute personal trainer dude who spends 5 extra minutes lying on top of you, \"stretching out your hamstrings\" as his hot peppermint breath tickles the back of your neck. Yes, personal training is expensive but some things are priceless.\n\n2. THE PEOPLE THERE ARE SO SNOBBY! Mayfair was at one time primarily a racquet club and yes, tennis is for rich people. Some of the old timey tennis ladies in the morning are insufferable when they are snaggling around the lobby like a snatch of beavers in a woodpile but when you see them stripped down naked in the ladies' locker room, all cellulite and varicose veins with their petrified rock hard 25 year-old silcone titty balls slinging sadly over top of their menopausal middle pudge, you realize there really is no such thing as a caste society in a gym. You could totally take these bitches to town. Everybody else is super nice in comparison if you stop being so paranoid that they are all laughing at you because you have panty lines on your Lululemons.  Go commando, dumbo, and grow up and go make some friends. \n\n3. IT'S A FAMILY CLUB AND I AM SINGLE, I AM BETTER OFF AT AN AA MEETING. I know, I feel your pain, I am a prowling divorcee myself and if I see another age-appropriate (for moi) 50ish year old man and his desperate looking pushing 40ish year-old wife with their i-Pad slinging toddler, I will barf. The tale end of Generation X are in full-on spawn mode and they make for the worst parents EVER because they document everything on Facebook and Instagram and yes they have taken over the gym in a bad way. In my heyday, we put our children in the daycare and socialized at the bar and had affairs and lived life like a hot mess. Parents today are afraid of their children, \"Jaden doesn't like the daycare\" and so they roam the sanctuary of the gym with their iThings blasting out \"Frozen.\" They talk to their children loudly and slowly, referring to themselves in third person, so we can all hear what great parenting skills they have.  Little do they know, they are raising a new generation of sociopaths. But whatevs, hopefully they'll get bored of each other soon enough and the playing field gets levelled and we will all get bone where bone is due.

This place is owned by a gentleman named Alonso. Kudos to this guy, he welcomed us in like he was welcoming old friends to his own home. \n\nTHE RESTAURANT:\nIt's a spacious place, nice seating, nice lighting, fantastic chic decor, and a huge booth in one corner that made me want to come back with a group of friends. Located near downtown Mississauga, on one of the most crazy-in-terms-of-traffic-and-all-kinds-of-business intersection, Dundas and Hurontario. When I walked in on a Thursday night, we were the only ones, but I'd be shocked if this place wasn't packed on Friday-Saturday nights. \n\nTHE SERVICE:\nWe were served by Alonso (the owner) and a waitress. Both were very personable and helped us understand the menu. Alonso has the gift of the gab and he spoke of Columbian culture, food and how he came about to starting this business of his. I always like such passionate people and it was solely because of him that I took an instant liking to the place. The food and drinks just solidified my liking. \n\nTHE FOOD: \nSo much to choose from. Everything in the menu is Columbian, explained in English below. And I can't seem to remember the Columbian names of what we ordered. But here goes - my friend ordered a platter of different kinds of meat. And I ordered a chicken skewer wrapped in bacon. Both our dishes were delicious and filling. This is as authentic as it gets, folks!\n\nTHE DRINKS: \nColumbia Mia comes with all good things and a bar! And Alonso happens to be a brute of a bartender. My friend ordered Columbian wine. And I ordered my Margarita, off the menu.

The place we originally set out to visit turned out to be take-out and delivery only, so to the Iron City Grille it was.\n\nBoy, whoever owns the joint loves Pittsburgh like geeks love Sarah Michelle Gellar. It is sports-themed to the hilt, a shrine if there ever was one. Cardboard Steelers, photos, and sports memorabilia are all over the walls along with televisions. There was a Penguins game on when we visited, and the place was surprisingly dead. I can only imagine what kind of madhouse ICG becomes during a big game. Perhaps this is another well-kept  secret of Pittsburgh's western suburbs. \n\nWe started off with the Provolone Pretzel, and it is not what you think. Instead of being a hot pretzel stuffed with cheese (we were scratching our heads for a few minutes, thinking a mistake had been made), it's about 6 or so squares of provolone that are coated with a breading made from crushed hard pretzels and then deep fried.  After our confusion subsided, we relished the endless strands of cheese that formed upon each bite. ICG makes its own \"stone ground\" mustard as a dipping sauce, one that has more than a hint of horseradish in it yet possesses a sweetness to it that holds its own against the intensity of the other ingredients. What restaurants make their mustard? Not enough that's for sure. ICG could bottle it, but then it would no longer be special.  *sigh*\n\nBeing a Burger Slayer, I had to kill me an Iron City Burger, a monstrosity of chopped Angus beef, onion straws, BBQ sauce, lettuce, tomato, and cold dill pickle that gave me a bit of trouble, those onion straws acting as appendages designed to keep the meat at bay. It is one of those burgers that takes a while to chip away at. You must mount a circular attack, munching around the edges to make the burger more manageable (vulnerable?). The best burgers are often challenging to eat, and eating this one was certainly test a test of wills (appetite?). Finally getting a bite of the medium-cooked meat was carnivorous rapture. \n\nSomeone in the area learned how to make french fries properly; they need to be as crispy externally as they are soft internally, these fries being a near-perfect example of that kind of balance. \n\nThe cole slaw that acted as a side wasn't bad either. It was cool, crunchy, yet was a touch overdressed with Marzetti dressing.\n\nKay got the fish and chips and complained that her fried tilapia filets had little flavor. I got a couple of tastes and concurred despite the velvety texture. A good rub might have made it sing.   \n\nFor dessert it was a slice of a Robin Cole Cheesecake. It seems as if the ex-Steeler has become a dessert maker, and based on the cheesecake, has carved out a fine niche for himself beyond the gridiron. I've been having a cheesecake jones on my back for several weeks, and this satisfied my fix. \n\nI'm still befuddled over the lack of customers here. Did we come during a lull in the action?

If you've ever had chipped ham, it's easy to see why there was a shortage since it's a frickin' delicacy 'round here.\n\nI get to work at 11:30 AM and unwrap my burger. \n \nWhere do they find these manhole cover sesame buns? \n\nA pretty damn tasty, sandwich, I got it with lettuce, tomato, onion, and mayo, which is the standard for me. Was it the best in Brookline? Thus begins another quest. It gives Tessaro's burger and The Tic-Toc burger a good match but taps after the 4th round, but it does put anything from McDonald's, Wendy's, or Burger King to sleep. We're talking 1st round TKO here. \n\nI have to knock off a point for the fries. I know frozen Ore-Idas when I see em!

I'll never get what you see in this restaurant, though. It all looks so promising. Good location, busy professionals bustling in and out, free wifi! \n\nThe microcosm all shatters after that.\n\nFirst off, as another reviewer mentioned, the line is straight out of junior high. You walk over, grab a tray, and then proceed to an utterly befuddling system of pre-made food, people making food, people waiting for pre-made and yet-to-be-made food. What the heck is going on in this line? I want a half sandwich and cup of soup. They have no sandwiches made, so they give me a giant number on a metal pole. I proceed to the logjam of people waiting for custom salads to be made. Do I go around them to get my soup? Do I wait? Some people seem to be waiting. \n\nSomeone asks me if I need soup. I open my mouth and manage, \"I---\" when a lady behind me shouts, \"Cup of lemon chicken orzo!\" Oh, you. You know the lady. Smart ponytail, pointy nose, voice that destroys and overrides every other sonic frequency.\n\nOh, people cut me. YES. Junior high. People are taking cutsies, for the love of Pete. People in skirts and people in ties. I realize that I've gone to the same place for lunch as salespeople and HR representatives who drive black Hummers and black Yukons with black Cardinals license plates, flicking cigarettes out the windows and failing to signal lane changes as they go. And they're cutting me in line. How did my judgment get so clouded?\n\nNow someone hands me my sandwich and takes back my giant number. I am now at the cashier. Another bottleneck. The people here have no money handling skills--they are handed legal tender and they inspect it as if someone gave them kroner and they're mentally performing a currency conversion. Five more minutes go by, and my toes are getting numb from standing in line. Do I have a (mumble) card? No, no. Whatever it is, I don't have it, and I don't want it. I'll never be back here.\n\nI get to the drink station and more people cut me as I try to set my tray down and get tea. I realize I overshot the silverware and try to step back that way. Someone heads me off at the pass and takes the last FOUR soup spoons.\n\nI finally sit down and attempt to enjoy a few minutes of solitude. I'm in the north room. After 70 seconds, a woman asks me if I'd like to try some Thai salad. I decline, and hear card shuffling. I'm not in a dining room, I'm in a card room. Women are playing bridge or rummy or cribbage and they are laughing raucously. The uniquely annoying sounds of metal-footed chairs being drug across a tile floor reverberate through my eardrums as other women prepare to turn the room into a mahjong parlor. One of them dumps a whole box of mahjong tiles on a comically small table and they laugh as the tiles tinkle to the floor.\n\nSomewhere next to me a guy's giant number on a metal pole tips over and clangs to the floor.

I ordered the 3 piece chicken with some cajun fries and red beans and rice. The fried chicken comes either mild or spicy. The chicken itself was piping hot and the batter was an exact replica of Popeye's where you have the crunchy and flakier exterior. The chicken itself was very juicy and the spices are great. The skin is the real winner (as with all fried chicken) and it's what makes the chicken. I don't think it was as good as Popeye's though. Even though it seemed to be exactly the same, there's just something about Popeye's chicken. Maybe they didn't use as much crack as Popeye's does? Not sure.\n\nThe Red Beans and rice are incredible. The red bean mash has a wonderful kick to it and mixed with the rice creates a nice blend of simple and spicy. The cajun fries were pretty good too.

I told the barista he got my order wrong, and politely asked if I could take the wrong drink to give to my friend (the drink would be tossed out anyway).

If I have the option, you can bet it will be from Papa Murphy's!\n\nIf you're not familiar with Papa Murphy's, they are a \"take and bake\" pizza place, meaning that you get your pizza prepared at the shop, take it home, and bake it yourself. This helps drive down the extra costs you incur when you order delivery.\n\nThe pizzas themselves are FANTASTIC! They have several different styles of crust from which you can choose: Thin, Hand-Tossed, or Stuffed. The first two types are pretty self-explanatory. But the \"Stuffed\" pizza is a completely different beast. It's essentially a pizza within a pizza. I can only confirm that it looks incredible...I'd never be brave enough to actually try it. I'm afraid I might have a heart attack after the first bite!\n\nThe pizza with which I am the MOST familiar is the Chicken Bacon Artichoke. It comes on a thin crust, and it's absolutely LOADED with the aforementioned toppings. We, being a family of three, usually opt for the Family Size pizza. Though, sometimes it feels like that might be a bit much...but it's just so good! \n\nNow, this location is newly opened. Of course, the facility is in immaculate condition. My initial fear was that the new location meant new employees. But, it appears that they may have imported experienced people from different locations. Upon entering, every person in the joint greeted me. Each employee was well-versed in their craft, as every pizza they made while I was there looked AMAZING! There were even a couple of the employees in the background showing off their pizza-crust-spinning abilities! (MAN I wish I could do that!)\n\nNow, the thing that sets this place apart, for me, is what happens AFTER they finish making your pizza. They wrap the pizza, and they always double-check to make sure you know how to prepare the dish when you get home...after all, not everybody is a pizza lush like me!!! After they're sure you know what you're doing, they walk your pizza around the counter, hand it to you, and then they hold the door open for you!!! I know it doesn't seem like THAT big of a gesture, but when you're trying to hold a man-hole-cover sized pizza in one hand, and a three year old in the other, that gesture makes all the difference in the world!\n\nI've been to Papa Murphy's all across the country. Before this location opened up, the closest one to me was the one on Union Hills. Now that this location has opened up on Greenway, I fear for my waistline.

Everything from the menu, to the food, to the decor seems to reflect this - mimicking what a genuine artisan bakery/family-owned cafe might look like. Additionally, giant signs that basically scream \"Franchise!\" everywhere seal the deal. I'm not sold.\n\nIt's a weird system - you go up to the counter, order your meal (pizza and pasta deals, soups, salads, sandwiches are your mains). Staff are friendly enough, but also a giveaway that the people behind the counter don't love or worship the food the way a true artisan establishment would. They love it the way they might love being behind a Tim Horton's counter. After ordering, you get one of those flashy black notifiers that blinks when your order is ready (wow! really traditional and authentic!). Sadly, the table next to us had a faulty one and had their meals sitting at the counter with no claimant, and a confused server running around checking everyone's flashy thinger.\n\nFood was average considering the price - pizza is a thicker dough with lots of air bubbles, and it tastes alright, fine but nothing noteworthy. Something of note, however, is a rather reasonable multigrain crust. Surprisingly doesn't taste like cardboard and there are poppy seeds! Charming! Among our party was someone who ordered soup and another who went for the cannelloni. All came with a nice crispy salad, which was perfect on the patio.

We stay at RCTV HQ off the Strip, (aka Mel's Place), which is about 3-5 minutes away by car on Sahara Ave., near Boulder Hwy.

DDDanny's Dad, the aforementioned Mel, turned us on to this joint, which has the cheapest grub and drinks in town. A Sam Adams on draft is a mere $2.25, and breakfasts run from 3.95 to about 8 bux, with generous portions that even Danny sometimes can't chow down. There's awesome pancakes, a variety of egg dishes, great combos, and a big ol' burger with fries for only $4.95.\n\nNot only that, but it's all served up cheerfully by a very sweet bunch of ladies, who know our host Mel very well, and by now have come to expect our yearly visits.\n\nAll that being said, it's not for the diet conscious. It's good, hearty and greasy--perfect to buck up after a wild late nite drinking and debauchery session, which we often have while visiting during the annual AVN Awards/ Adult Entertainment Expo.", "business_id": "F0c5AMuF_w49727bE7xV1w", "stars": 5, "date": "2009-01-15", "useful": 5, "type": "review", "cool": 4}, {"funny": 4, "user_id": "qibGLHABNReGeJr2w4_8yQ", "review_id": "_1w2ueJ1g4iIak0w4h6qMA", "text": "I normally am not a lunch eater.

Gordon comes to a struggling restaurant and gives them an update, facelift, revision to make them successful. This place has a lot of good things going for it, but I think Steak on a Stone is its own worst enemy.\n\nThe dining room decor is ok... it feels a little dated even though I know this place is somewhat newish. Maybe it was the time of day (6:00pm on a weekday) but it felt too cavernous and empty. Something a little more hip, a little more intimate would have felt like a better dining experience.\n\nPeople on here seem to have beef (har har) with the fact you cook your steak on a stone. See title of restaurant. I thought this was great, and I did get a different flavor experience by quickly cooking each bite on a lava rock. It made me slow down and enjoy my dinner. I also like the fact that you can choose from a variety of interesting dipping sauces. Way to go, SOAS!\n\nOkay, so ... good concept with the steak and sauces, so WHY IS THERE ALSO A GIANT GREEK MENU? If Gordon has taught me anything about running a restaurant, it's that you need to keep your menu small and stay true to the concept. It's like this place had a couple of partners who couldn't agree on the menu and one of them wanted to have a full greek menu or else he wasn't going to invest. I dunno why anyone would do this. Open a second restaurant. It seems super strange and I'm sure it isn't cheap to continue to stock those ingredients. Stick with your niche. \n\nLastly, two little minor details that bugged me:\n(1) The butter came in plastic peel-off lid pats. Everything about this place is trying to be \"classy\" but then the butter comes off in peel-a-pat. This isn't Bob Evans, especially not what you're charging for a steak. Simply chilling some butter balls in a bowl would elevate the experience.\n(2) It smells really strange when you first walk in. It's just the smell of burnt fat from cooking steak on those lava rocks... and though it is tasty, the general smell in the restaurant isn't appealing or appetite-inducing. Maybe it's the mix with the greek food, I don't know.", "business_id": "DMRaPL6SnA_RX7yY6rprhQ", "stars": 3, "date": "2010-08-26", "useful": 3, "type": "review", "cool": 3}, {"funny": 5, "user_id": "jfPJWKxVLIlWu5MDcAMftA", "review_id": "fiISWqLEoNPJF2bj_6K9ZA", "text": "I am a recent employee of this horrid establishment and would love to share my two cents on what really goes on here. The two owners, Rodger and Cathy have absolutely no idea how to run a restaurant and care more about making money than they do keeping their employees/customers happy. I have witnessed them fire a kitchen employee because he gave a server a ramekin of blue cheese without a ticket being ran in! They also threatened to fire me because I added shredded cheese to a salad and not charge the customer an extra $2.\n\nThese are just minor issues compared to the concept and overall feel of the restaurant. First, the building was an old Don Panchos that shut down and there has been no renovations inside to give Steak on a Stone it's own feel. The walls still has the bright red paint left over from a Mexican Restaurant. They so desperately want to be an upscale, high-class restaurant but it will never happen. The employees wear polos with a patch on the chest which screams chain restaurant!! The also serve burgers and sandwiches which should NEVER be allowed on the menu at a STEAK house. \n\nThe food is so-so but extremely overpriced. So If you want a $12 steak for $25 AND you have to cook it for yourself, be my guest. \n\nI only worked there for 3 months and the employee turnover was ridiculous. Within my first week there were 6 servers who quit. Over my 3 months I saw roughly 15 servers walk out the door because there was no structure and constant yelling from management. This explains the horrible service because chances are you are being served by someone who has only been working there for 2 weeks being trained by someone who has only been there a month!\n\nI would not recommend this restaurant to anybody who wants to have a good night out and enjoy a great, affordable meal.

She made a sparkling sake with fresh pressed roasted beet juice. Definitely tasty. I also loved this muddled orange and mango gin drink. All the drinks were like a dream of things I wanted to do last year in many restaurants.  Since we ate already we ordered apps, 3 different beets salad one golden beet, one candy cane, and then a fire roasted. It was phenomenal. I also liked the crab salad with Rice milk and sake...it lightened it up very nicely. But definitely expensive. I would knock it for the price but I understand rent is expensive. But over all I would love to come here again for a full dining experience.", "business_id": "ByF6BhEWd8if3hiNM-BU9w", "stars": 4, "date": "2008-09-02", "useful": 3, "type": "review", "cool": 3}, {"funny": 3, "user_id": "N044aCKJv3G5WuvwT5AJcA", "review_id": "cq3uIUGm7-QwKZ7KxJ9HJQ", "text": "Heard some rumblings that this place might be closing soon. I've been waiting for a great night on the tables to cover the cost of this meal but i've been on quite the losing streak lately. Decided to use the excuse that i got a new job as reason to spend some serious $$ and try this place one last time ( assuming the worst ) \n\nsurprised to see the place was 1/2 full. pleased  that they gave us a nice booth instead of the table by the kitchen entrance dealio like our last visit. \n\nVery pleased that the bartender was receptive to preparing a non-alcoholic drink for my girl - she was hoping for something with blueberries - they prepared a blueberry basil drink that was very refreshing. I started with a simple brewski to quench the thirst then opted for the orange blossom ( $19 - geez ! ) - i tell ya - the bartender didin't hold back on the liquor - excellent. \n\nwe went ala carte again. \n\ngirl went with the pea soup ( w/ shrimp dumpling ) - $26 \nMaine Lobster - $65 \n\ni chose the octopus ( $22 ) \nhamachi w/48 hour braised short ribs - $52 \n\nwe shared some mushrooms with pork belly \n\nsome similarities to our first visit as to the items we selected. \n\nthe highlights - the hamachi w/the ribs - SPECTACULAR ! not sure it matters if the ribs cook for 24-36-48 hours but a great compliment to the hamachi. \n\nThe mushrooms w/ pork belly - what's the deal with pork belly ? i love it. as i'm moaning and groaning about how good it is, i see out of the corner of my eye a server standing at a distance watching me - he probably thought i was spanking it ! \n\nFor dessert - milk chocolate cheesecake - also a major hit. I gotta give props to the pastry chef - i asked if there was a chance they could give me a little taste of the tangerine sorbet that was Incorporated into another dessert. they sent along a nice scoop to try - without a doubt, the best sorbet i've ever had ! again, a whole lot of moaning while i ate that. also the little plate of treats, my girl loved the almonds dusted with cinnamon ( they were impressive ) asked the server if they could spare a few more - not a problem , a plate of them appears before us in a matter of minutes. \n\ni also went with a pinot grigio with the app - livio - decent ( $18) and with the hamachi - a blend called \"plexus\" - i can't remember the three grapes - syrah for sure - also very good ( $24) \n\ntotal bill including coffee and water $317 . when do i get that 1st paycheck !\n\nnot sure if this place is gonna survive or not.  I'm thankful i had a chance to experience it.", "business_id": "ByF6BhEWd8if3hiNM-BU9w", "stars": 4, "date": "2009-04-23", "useful": 5, "type": "review", "cool": 5}, {"funny": 3, "user_id": "7Ek4da_Btvznc4Q4S0_Bag", "review_id": "MB_o6b7GczjZM0sFdsFgVg", "text": "Despite being in Vegas alone, I kept most of the reservations I'd made with a pal who ended up not coming. Checked in at Restaurant Charlie the day before to see if I could have a choice between Bar Charlie and the restaurant. Things were pretty dead so there was no problem; not even with changing my reservation by an hour 45 min beforehand. \n\nThey told me I could eat at the restaurant bar if I didn't want to dine alone at a table. They also said the bartender would be fine company. So I got seated in the super modern, glass steel and light  and completely empty bar. I have to say it was a little weird. Nobody told the bartender I was dining at the bar and for a while he thought I was waiting for somone and was focussing on other things. I worried the experience would be boring and surreal like the last scene of 2001 where the old guy is having a nice meal and all you hear is his utensils clinking on the plate.\n\nAnyway once we figured things out, everything improved. The bartender was Jeremy. I first ordered a campari cocktail (campari, sweet vermouth, brandy floater with a twist). I think this gave him some good information because with each of the four courses I ordered, he provided a very interesting and virtually always stellar pairing, and it wasn't always wine. Here's what I had with the pairings listed with each course.\n\nAmuse: A bit of watermelon salad in tiny cubes with either basil or mint (or both?), and a shot glass of watermelon soup with tiny fresh spearmint leaves. Delicate poached lobster claw meat two nice bites with herb sauce (sorry not sure about the sauce...). LOVED every morsel of this.\n\nAppetizer: Fried Spiced Globe Artichoke with Honey, Pine nuts, and Mint. Great, but you have to love cumin.\nMy pairing: Campari cocktail with brandy floater\n\nEntree: Seared Hamachi with Braised Short Rib, Morels & Chantrelle Mushroom Sauce\nJ's pairing: 2002 Franz Haas \"Manna\" Alto Adige, Italy\n\nSide: Saffron Rissoto with Cockles and Razor Clams\nJ's new pairing when I got stuffed and couldn't eat any more risotto: Junmei Divine Droplets (Sake)\n\nSalad at end: Salad of Asparagus, Rhubarb, Fennel & Nasturtium Leaves - heavenly; a beautiful ending.\nJ's pairing: Chartreuse with Stirings Soda & Lemon (amazing!)\n\nDessert: Candies & Confections\n1971 Bodegas Toro Albala \"Pedro XImenez Gran Reserva\" Montilla-Moriles, Spain (this is the most delicious port I ever had, and he put the bottle in front of me and casually asked if I wanted more - I did not care about price at that point).\n\nWe started talking about the port so much he brought over the sommalier who knew more about it, and then they handed me a big book from which I sat reading aloud, and nobody minded at all (um, I think).\n\nThe hamachi with short rib was amazing. The short rib was almost like a ragu and it was carefully spread atop each chunk of Hamachi. The richness of the short rib balanced perfectly with the buttery quality of the hamachi. My only complaint which I did not voice was that the mushrooms were way beyond salty.\n\nThe only thing I couldn't paddle to the finish on was the rissotto, and Jeremy rallied me by switching me from wine to divine droplets sake - fermented from the very center of the rice kernel. The sake sweetended up the super saffrony risotto and really made the flavor of the rice jump out. It actually lightened the dish significantly and helped me put away about 30 percent more. \n\nThe chartreuse beverage with the herby salad totally blew me out of the water, because it went incredibly well with the salad (the rhubarb was lightly pickled and in the thinnest of shavings, resembling pickled ginger in a way) and I was dying for a digestif by that point.\n\nThe whole thing ended up being fun. Jeremy and the rest of the staff at Restaurant Charlie are maniacs in a good way. I think I was a little lucky in my proximity to a very special and insightful, educated bartender, and the fact that it was a slow night may have helped somewhat, but  if you are a food and drink freak try dining at the bar and have a wonderful interactive experience with all the pairings, or just make sure to emphasize your interest in that if you are in the dining room.  Really fun and great quality.\n\nOnly cons were that things came out kind of fast after my appetizer -- I wasn't finished with my entree and side when the salad also appeared before me. Not that big a deal but the pacing of serving a salad as the last course shouldn't be foreign to a fine dining staff.", "business_id": "ByF6BhEWd8if3hiNM-BU9w", "stars": 5, "date": "2008-06-26", "useful": 5, "type": "review", "cool": 4}, {"funny": 4, "user_id": "4wp4XI9AxKNqJima-xahlg", "review_id": "IT0BvI44bvTRuoZ8s-EQyA", "text": "The owners couldn't be nicer and more helpful!

The owner of the company I work for decided it was finally time to get read of all the documents he'd been hoarding over the years (we're talking about A LOT of documents). Because of the type of business we are in, much of the information contained in the documents was highly proprietary, hence the reason he was skeptical about getting rid of it so quickly.\n\nTo be honest, though, for a long time he had us employees here shredding the documents ourselves a little at a time in a small shredder here in the office. Needless to say, this method left a mess on the floor, the office smelling like burnt paper / silicon computer components, paying far too much by the hour for a tedious activity, and the feeling of angst from the monotony accumulated in the air.\n\nAfter planting the seed one day about getting all the papers shredded, the boss-man finally decided to go for it. So of course I immediately began the search for a place that could best serve our one-time shredding need. That's when I ran into these guys with a Yelp coupon. Before purchasing the coupon I called the business with a few logistical questions -- the whens, wheres, and the how-much's -- and the staff was extremely friendly and even connected me to guy named Trevor who I later realized is the owner of the company.\n\nWe sent a date for a couple weeks out (at my request) to come and pick up the vast mountain of paper we needed to get rid of. The deal was 500 lbs. of paper for $50 (a $75 value at regular price). When the day came to pick up the stuff, a quiet gentleman came in and did the dirty work. We are even located on the second floor of the building and he came and got everything. It took a couple trips but the gentleman gathered it all without any problems. I was even surprised when I attempted to help (since there was quite a bit; maybe even over the 500lb limit) and he encouraged me to relax and that he would take care of it. He was a man of few words but he did his job efficiently and effectively.\n\nNow, the office looks incredibly clean. I've never seen this place like this. I'm so glad we went this route with getting all our documents eliminated.

All the workers are volunteers as I understand it.  There is even a gift shop to help raise money for the cause.  All right there on the library premises where you can stop by before or after you check out your materials.\n\nNot only are the volunteers cheerful and helpful but the food is delicious! My favorite is the chicken salad sandwich, followed close by the tuna salad.  They serve a variety of coffees and smoothies, a few simple breakfast items and desserts, snow cones, Italian sodas (which I usually get) Frappes, etc.  There is usually a Daily Special and you can get a combo with  chips and drink.  Everything I've had here was wonderful.  \n\nThere is another location of Cup O'Karma up in Mesa on Southern, too.", "business_id": "AP9WYVvWFZLlZ7fyzpd23g", "stars": 5, "date": "2014-09-04", "useful": 7, "type": "review", "cool": 6}, {"funny": 4, "user_id": "kjeX2RXvW7RhBbD2QLd5jA", "review_id": "2c9IYCqQDpslK4-HHIapZg", "text": "(Lyrics - Belle - Beauty and the Beast - Bonjour)\n\nSan Carlos; it's a quiet hotel\nWith a restaurant, Bonjour Vietnam\nDowntown in the city of Phoenix, having lunch to say........\n\nBonjour!

Very modern look and feel with some Vietnamese flares.  I didn't catch anything that I would consider French inspired except what was on the menu.  \n\nI ordered a Saigon beer, which I haven't had since I was in Vietnam several years ago, but they were out!  Second choice was Export 33, which was also a Vietnamese beer; oh the memories!  Now to the entree!  I ordered the Cornish Hen with rice.  Forgot what is was called, but it was pretty good.  I think it was marinated and crusted with sweet and spicy sauce; the hen itself was pretty moist and the crust was perfect and crunchy.  I gotta say it worked well along with the steam rice. I would definitely subtract the 2 pieces of squash it came with and the beef broth; which was just pho broth.  I just didn't care too much for it plus it didn't make sense but to fill the plate.  \n\nOverall, the food was good and the service was decent.  The place is oddly placed in the San Carlos Hotel!?  Which I guess is haunted thus the \"Ghost Lounge\" next door.  Unfortunately, the only ghost around was the lack of patrons and people in the city of Phoenix.

Not understanding a word I said.. he just laughs like I said something funny and says \"ya ya.. $27\" I explained to him that a large is $18 and I was to get 3 for 1. He said that the company changed the prices of the pizzas to $6.95 each with the special so 3 pizzas is $27. Now I never claimed to be a math-ma-gician but if I take 3X7.. I get 21. So I told him that didn't make sense and he went into a very long explanation, none of which made any sense. I very politely told him, that the email I got said buy 1 get 2 free, that I was quoted $18 buy the gentleman on the phone and that if this wasn't possible, that I would be leaving without the pizzas.

Its amenities include a playground,  picnic area, open grass area, gazebo, baseball and softball, the Jaynes Family Splash Pad, and a trailhead for the Paseo Walking Path. \n\n  When I review small parks I am finical. I look at aspects that include the grass, adjacent neighborhood,  and condition of the park. And right off the bat I am docking a star for the visible patches of dead grass plus graffiti on the rules & regulations sign. This is not the ethereal green carpet that I remember napping on back in 2008. For crying out loud when I go on Google Maps and zoom in here, the patches of dead grass stare me in the face. The caretakers of the park need to seriously invest in a better sprinkler system or go the way of xeroscaping. \n\n  It turns out that the caretakers of the park has invested in a different kind of water infastructure. It is the Jayne's Family Water/ Splash Park adjacent to the north border of the original park. In contrast to the mood that the dead grass could put people in, the water park is an upbeat place for kids of all ages to cool off. I do believe with a conviction that some of the overflowing water could be channeled to the grassy field.\n\n  I give Goett Family Park high marks for its connectivity. It is in a nice neighborhood.  It is contiguous to the Paseo Walking Path, which is a 0.77 recreational paved trail winding through an attractive landscape. It was the Paseo Walking Trail that brought me to Goett Family Park. Looking north there is a nice vista of an undeveloped hill. For the likes of me I am unsuccesful finding out the name of it, and that is if it has one. If you have seen nearby Exploration Park in Mountain's Edge, it looks similar. If there was a trail from Goett Family Park to the hill, I would bring it back up a star.\n\n  I am a fan of the outdoors-even in the triple digit temperature of summer. Chances are that when I visit Southern Highlands with time to kill, there is a possibility that I will relax for a few minutes in Goett Family Park before hiking on The Paseo Walking Path.\n\n***The 2013 Yelp Challenge.

Charleston. Make your reservation early as there are only 12 sites and it gets busy. I was lucky enough to book a site 1 week before Memorial Day and found out from the campers across from me their friend had cancelled last minute the day I booked, so I got lucky! \n\n12 sites that are for small to medium trailers. There is 1 site in the back that will take a larger RV. I think it is number 11. The sites have electric hook ups and water hook ups. They also have a cement table, fire pit and large square dirt area for a large tent if you need it. We were at site number 8 and the tent area was off to the side which would make a cool hideout for the kids. \n\nKyle Canyon Rd is near the campground so during the day we did hear a lot of cars and motorcycles go through but at night it was very quiet. They do have a host on the property and he is very committed to his job. This is not a campground for parties and loud music. It is a great family type campground and place to chill. At one point during the day we did have our music up and the host came by and said if he could hear it from the road, it was too loud. He did come by each day and provide us with a fresh trash bag and even offered to take our trash from us each morning. He provided a booklet and map of the area as well. Great Service. \n\nOff to the left of the campground is a trail that will take you down to the visitor center. The road was paved for a while and then got rocky, so we had to turn around as we had assumed it was paved the whole way and had a stroller with us. Off to the right is a secluded wooded area that we had a great time exploring. There was a ton of broken sleds and winter gear there from people playing in the snow. We saw a lot of animal prints and the host advised us that a lot of dear lived in the area were were exploring. \n\nThere is a bathroom as well on site with showers.

Chuck & Co. looked like a nice spot. Also, they had a huge sign out front that said BRUNCH. \n\nInside is airy and modern. There is a big bar-height table in the middle, and several 2-seaters at the sides. There's an open kitchen at the back and one of the friendliest servers I've ever met running around. \n\nLuckily, we weren't hungover (thus being awake at 12 noon) because it was also full of 30-ish couples and their screaming children. Normally, this isn't a huge deal, since they weren't really making THAT much of a racket, but the place had high ceiling and tiled walls, creating some kind of screaming baby nightmare cave.\n\nThe brunch was very good. The fresh squeezed OJ was indeed freshly squeezed and just amazing, though pricey at $5 a glass (anyone who's ever worked a brunch shift at a restaurant and had to squeeze the OJ will consider this is more than fair). I had the classic breakfast: 2 eggs, 2 pieces of toast, a big honking slice of bacon (more on that later) and frites for $9. Considering the area, this wasn't bad. The eggs were perfectly runny and the bacon was just.. almost indescribably incredible. After gushing about it, our server told us that they buy it in a huge slab, then cut it nice and thick (at least 1/4\" at my estimation). It was perfectly flavoured and fatty, and cooked soft, which is how i requested it. It made my morning. The frites were thin crispy, but a little cold, probably because there was only one cook on staff and the place was pretty busy. They definitely had potential and I'd like to try them again just to make sure. Husband was reasonably happy with his breakfast crepe.\n\nBoth of us were really happy with the meal and the service, and will probably return again to check out their burgers.

If you have never been, it's located around the newly revamped area, Liberty Village. It's a little outta town, but trust me it's worth the commute. Warning yelpers, it's a long entry.\n\nWe went for a late dinner and my advice to anyone heading there a little before closing time, you can always place your orders for pick up. We placed our orders 30 minutes before closing and told them we would be there in about 15 or so minutes. We got there a little later but the food was fresh and ready for us. Instead of simply picking up our order, we asked if it's okay if we just ate here quickly. We felt kinda bad as they were closing in 10 mins, but the staff was very and I repeat again, very friendly. They said, don't rush and enjoy the food. So a very good first impression of the restaurant so far.\n\nWe ordered a ton of food so here's a list of what we got. My gf got the Bacon Cheddar Burger with fries and an ice tea. I got the Breakfast Burger and the Bacon Cheddar Burger with onion rings and a Black Cherry Boylan Soda. We also ordered a new drink called, New Leaf. It's a honeydew melon white tea sweetened with pure cane suger (sorry, no review here as we didn't end up drinking it). We got our food and proceeded to sit down. I looked at my gf and she seems to like the decor as well. It seems to show a little more character than W Burger Bar as it's a little more rustic, but in a modern way. There's a strong contrast with the decor inside and it worked.\n\nOur first couple of bites into the Bacon Cheddar Burger... AMAZING! We were trying to hold ourselves back as we knew what happened at W Burger Bar. So we decided to try out the onion rings and fries... and the onion rings, AMAZING as well. We were a little blown away. The fries on the other hand, good but nothing special. Went back to the burger and it was just as good, no joke. And I have to say, I think the onion rings are probably one of the best onion rings I have ever had. All the sides were made from scratch and the patty of course. We can taste the freshness of it and I liked the seasoning. I'm curious how this burger would taste with a regular sesame bun than their toasted ciabatta bun. Now the Breakfast burger was good, but not as good as the Bacon Cheddar Burger. How were the drinks you might ask? Well the drinks we good, but I liked the Johnnie Ryan Coke better from Burger Bar. Weird I know, but I'm definitely willing to give the Boylan drink a second chance the next time I'm back at Chuck & Co.\n\nOverall, I definitely liked Chuck & Co. Not only were the staff very friendly, I mean they were closing the tills, counting money, etc while we were eating. We didn't end up leaving till about 10 minutes or so after their closing time and they were STILL very nice. They even asked how was the food and everything with a smile, told us to have a goodnight as we left. So customer service was excellent. And the burger? A little messy but I liked the Bacon Cheddar Burger quite a bit and this will be the highest burger rating to date. I know my gf enjoyed it, maybe not as much as me... but definitely in her top list as well. The onion rings? One of the best as well, forget the fries Go for the ONION RINGS! So I recommend Chuck & Co. I'm waiting for a second trip back to see if maybe we just had a fluke good night, or maybe this something we can always expect. If I were to go back and it's the same results, trust me... this might be one of the better burger places period, I'm serious.", "business_id": "C9YQJ2eOkNjIRuZmthvyMw", "stars": 4, "date": "2010-12-12", "useful": 2, "type": "review", "cool": 4}, {"funny": 7, "user_id": "BGzavA_ddMr-jGmhArv7fg", "review_id": "QpRjLSrrPpbZX-ZWhP17Rg", "text": "Y'all know when you're the club and this fly-looking honey comes up to you, and you're like, \"damn girl,\" because she's beautiful and by some miraculous alignment of the stars, she sticks around long enough for you to sidle up to her and then she starts talking and you're like \"oh, this really isn't the flavourful burger I was expecting at all.

He combines flavors from all over the world to create a single dish that is harmony in your mouth. There's just so many small touches that make this such a great restaurant. I personally recommend the tasting menu. Just do it. I don't like shell fish but the crab I had was just crazy good. Also the wine pairing is perfect. They know what there doing here. I have trouble justifying coming back to a place more then once with so many options in the burgh but I will be back and very very soon.", "business_id": "BHWIl_wI7P58JrODocBjkg", "stars": 5, "date": "2014-09-04", "useful": 5, "type": "review", "cool": 3}, {"funny": 3, "user_id": "fDc8jm1KheUugqRLjj-2BA", "review_id": "EY65IBO3NiffDdOBEe3VFg", "text": "Chef David Racicot is a culinary phoenix.

I love a good sauce and the added bonus was watching them compliment the dish with the pairing sauce (see, fancy!). I thought the beets were great. I was a bit disappointed with the scallops, as I felt it could have used a bit more flavor. I loved the tenderloin though! They don't even ask you how you want it cooked, it just comes out medium rare, like it should be cooked all the time! I also really enjoyed the dessert. I loved the little bits of banana pudding mixed with the Nutella cake.\n\nAll the plates were small, but I was full by the time I was done. Not stuffed, but totally satisfied. And I lied, one of the bonus rounds was chocolate truffles, chocolate sticks and chocolate wafers. I was totally into this bonus round and even may have finished off others truffles. Oops. \n\nBut dining here is an experience. It's not just a dinner out. The way the wait staff caters to your every need, describes every single dish to you as it comes out and replaced every single napkin if you get up.

They even serve Pho, which is already quite out of place, but they didn't even have it available when we were there. \n\nWe came here the day after their grand opening and more than half their menu wasn't available to order. For veggies, they only had lettuce, nothing else, and they wanted to charge $7 for it. Seriously? SF supermarket is right next door. Is it that hard to walk over and buy some ingredients?\n\nWe ended up ordering two clay pots (which the waiter recommended we order because it would feed up to five people), but when it came, it looked look they were pizza hut personal pan style servings. The size of one pot looks like it wouldn't be enough for even one person, and they were charging $6 for it. Tony's review is correct, it literally looks like they just mixed up the rice with some meat, added some sauce and oil, then put it in the claypot. There were no crisp burnt rice sticking against the pot ().\n\nWe also ordered beef dry chow fun, which was ok tasting, but lacked the \"wok air\" (). We were still hungry, so we ordered some salty fish chicken fried rice. That was decent, but portion was small. \n\nService: This is the most disappointing part of the experience. I understand it's their second day of operation, but the waiters literally looked like they just started working there for the very first time. Menus were not given to us immediately when we sat down. We had to remind them to give us the basic utensils and napkins. Tea was not promptly refilled when we were out. They literally didn't study their own menu. We ordered by dish name and they didn't know what the menu item # was or where to find it.

Then the announcement that we would all have to sit in the waiting room until judges called saying they were completely finished choosing those 2 said juries came... my heart sank.

I went from \"how can I finagle my way out of this,\" to \"how can I get ON a jury.\" The difference? My unemployment benefits are long gone. I NEED the money. Even if it's only $40 a day. \n\nThanks to my low number, I was among the first 45 potential jurors herded into line. I was included in the first 23, designated the \"panel.\" That means I was one of the prime candidates. The additional 22 are drafted to assure a sufficient number to round out a jury after the grueling \"voir dire\" phase, the process by which jurors with potential biases are identified and excused.\n\nFrom the getgo, the case was explained as open-and-shut, likely to last only two days. Hey, 80 bucks! Enough to pay a utility bill or at the very least a little beer money. I kept quiet throughout the questioning. Prospective jurors are invited to relate their experiences about past encounters with law enforcement and the justice system. Had I any qualms about my ability to be impartial, I would have spoken up. I was under oath, after all. I decided hell no, I can be impartial. \n\nFor those wishing to escape jury duty, here is your chance. Just make an issue about any voir dire topic and you will likely be excused. It doesn't mean you are not worthy. From a pool of 45, 13 are selected based on their answers during voir dire. Getting excused from one panel doesn't necessarily get you off the hook, however. You must report back to Jury Services for possible reassignment.\n\nAfter the jury was empaneled (I was #12), a young woman protested that she had a job interview the following morning. \"Why didn't you say something?\" the judge asked. \"I didn't think I would be excused,\" she said. She needs a life coach. You are given every chance to state your reasons for not serving. The flimsiest excuse might be honored. If the judge and the attorneys agree, boom, you're gone. After the trial, the kindly judge (The Honorable Douglas W. Herndon) went so far as to apologize to the young lass. He told her he would gladly speak to the recruiter. \n\nUp to five days before your reporting date, you can call the automated system and reschedule.\n\nWhereas my first experience was painless, this time was a horror show. A thousand prospective jurors were called. The jury corral was crammed beyond capacity, with as many as 100 draftees having to stand outside until seating came available. Meanwhile, those inside the corral had to suffer in stifling heat, struggling for a breath of fresh air. Those with body odor issues made matters worse.\n\nJudge Herndon later explained that the throng of 1000 included 250 for one murder trial alone. The scene at the Fremont Street parking garage was another fright. The line to get in wound around two blocks. It took me 20 minutes to get in. Toward the front subhumans tried to barge in. Some fools actually let 'em. I say don't give these lowlifes an inch. What makes people like this feel entitled to cut in front and not wait like all the other chumps? One juror paid $20 at another garage rather than fight the mob.\n\nThe line waiting to get into the courthouse wound out the door and down the block. Another lengthy wait in the chilly wind. \n\nOnce inside, the gathering was subjected to a tiresome movie featuring the reprehensible and revolting husband-and-wife news team known as the Wagners. They managed to mangle the legal term \"peremptory,\" an inexcusable gaffe.\n\nAt first I was annoyed with the jury clerks screaming over the PA system. They acted toward the group as if they were military recruits or prison inductees. There's way too much yelling. The marshall who took our group to the 16th floor tried his hand at a drill sergeant impersonation. What a jerk, I thought. Later he calmed down and turned out to be nice enough. I came to realize the jury wranglers coped pretty well with conditions that made everyone miserable. \n\nThe brief trial was monotonous and repetitive. I found myself zoning out a couple of times but I quickly snapped out of it. You have to pay attention. This is serious business. \n\nThe case was air-tight. While the rest of us sat wondering what to do, a young woman brilliantly summarized the case in about three sentences. Another woman suggested a vote by raising hands. Guilty. Without two leaders who seized the initiative, it might have taken us a while longer to get our act together.\n\nAfter the trial, Judge Herndon visited with the jury for a brief informal chat. He's very impressive. As a fellow juror said, \"Now we know who to vote for next time.\"\n\nWe also had a chance to speak to the prosecutor. Dazed by the whole trial experience, I didn't have my wits about me. Later, I realized I should have asked him to thank Crystal Z., the heroic woman who confronted the drunk driver. So I will thank her now. When the near-comatose defendant pulled over on Summerlin Parkway, her ex-husband jumped out and yanked his keys.

Just a simple get in, get out operation. Little did I know that I would be confronted with so many different and tantalizing choices. The glass counter where the cupcakes are housed isn't really all that large. Yet, somehow, they manage to fit an incredible selection of all different tastes and styles in that amazing little space.\n\nAt first, I was a little sad, because I didn't see any carrot cupcakes. I was bouncing all around the case seeing fantastic visions of things called \"Toasted Coconut\", \"Red Velvet\", \"Gluten Free Key Lime\", \"Peanut Butter Chocolate\", and probably the most tempting of all, \"Thin Mint\".  (The \"Thin Mint\", along with the \"Somoa\" are special cupcakes for the month of March, 2013.)\n\nIt only took me a moment to shake off the haze and finally find the Carrot Cupcake I so desperately desired. It was on the bottom shelf, looking amazing! When I went to order it, the young lady behind the counter confronted me with a conundrum. She asked how many I wanted. In reality, I only wanted one...but, I'm only human. I couldn't really justify only bringing one cupcake home to a house of two women. So, I opted for a four pack.\n\nI took a second look at the display case, and I found this adorable chocolate cupcake topped with blue frosting and a sour gummy rainbow on top of it for my daughter.  It was as adorable looking as it sounds. For me, I REALLY wanted to get the Thin Mint cupcake. I asked the young lady if I would contract diabetes if I were to eat it. She laughed, but never really gave me a straight answer, so I didn't get it. I opted for the Toasted Coconut instead.\n\nThere was one final spot left in the box. Like I said before, there were so many tempting options from which to choose, and I hate multiple choice tests. I always talk myself out of the right answer. However, I don't know that there really COULD be a wrong answer with regards to delicious cupcakes. So, I settled (if you can call it that) on the Red Velvet cupcake.\n\nFor four cupcakes, I ended up paying just under $11.\n\nWhen I brought them home, my wife and daughter were tickled pink! We were each very excited to take a bite of these delicious works of art. The flavors were each fantastic. There was a perfect ratio of icing to cake. The texture of each complimented one another perfectly. The cakes were soft and moist, while the icing was firm, yet still very fresh.

As far as diamonds go, I'm a big fan.  A bright shinning star fan.  \n\nSo when we passed Harry's we had to go in.  (Well we didn't have to, but I'm dating a man that has an affinity for pretty things too - he's dating me, right?)\n\nI put on a necklace that I swear to you I would have worn vaccumming, and nothing else.  Of course Harry only has colorless diamonds.  I was infatuated.  Then William Friskhorn showed us a piece (a necklace) that is one of a kind.  None other in the world right now.  It was a mere 350k.  I choked.  I also tried to make my beautiful green eyes sparkle as much as the diamonds.\n\nI tried on a 5 carat emerald cut VS1 (or 2) ring with baquettes.  I started shaking.  We had to get out of there because I started sweating.  I'm not ready for that.  But it was the most beautiful piece I have ever placed upon my hand.  I'm telling you, this ring could have competed with Grace Kelly's 10 carat.  It was AH--- MAZING....\n\nSo I've said enough about the diamonds, let me get to the store itself.  Not pretentious and there for service.  These jewelers know their stuff.  Treat you with respect, and really, really were polite.  I carefully placed William'ss card in Joe's wallet right behind the AmEx (just in case)...we did discuss my necklace choices over dinner.  But none came home.  A girl can keep dreaming.  If and when we do go back, I'd love to make to to Harry's.  \n\nAs an addendum - I had to update my review with William's name.  I mean I did do a great job on product placement in his wallet.  I had to text my beau and he had it right where I had left it and was able to provide me with William's full name.\n\nWilliam was professional and knowledgable.  (And pretty hot I might add).

Clever. She knew this and made it clear she was not refunding me. At this point she didn't even give me the facial which was part of my deal. She told me to deal with the deal site, which I just do not have time to do. \n\nI went looking for a salon to get Shellac done - at around 7pm! I first stopped at the salon below Ms. Cruz's store at the back of the salon supply store. Unfortunately, they only do regular nail polish, but they giggled when I showed them my nails and asked if they think they are \"done\". That must mean something!\n\nI ended up going to another salon, just down Eglinton - Kozeta. They squeezed me in so I could have my spa treatment in before my vacation. When they saw the nail job Ms. Cruz did, they just shook their heads. \n\nI think what Ms. Cruz needs to learn is that it's not her \"16 years experience\" that matters. people make mistakes.

I was not angry at all about the Panties, but I was furious over this, and when I asked them to leave until I finished moving they didn't understand me due to the \"English Barrier\" So I called the front desk and they even called the cleaning ladies multiple times for them to leave. I could hear every bit of this over their walkie talkies but they still didn't leave till the panty stain was addressed.

I chose Blair House due to proximity to the LVCC, so I did not rent a car, and since it is on a one way road, even a cab ride wouldn't have helped with the time delay.\n\nFor the record, Melina was very nice but held no power to help me...

He bought me a pair, which I must say were and still are very comfortable. I have worn them daily to work.

Not only for my feet but my back as well. \n\nI purchased a second pair of Skechers recently at one of the outlet stores. These particular shoes were suppose to be better than the last pair and made to target the pressure points in ones foot. Yeah right!  While in LV I came upon the Skechers store on the strip, right across from the Wynn. I took myself and my sore little feet into this store. I spoke with the associate in regards to purchasing a better pair of shoes. She inquired as to why I did not like the pair I had on, an I discussed my concerns with her. In the end I did purchase another pair of shoes. The same style as the ones the love of my life had gifted to me. Who would have known a man could know just what would make my feet feel good?  Ha ha never doubt those that know you best. \n\nWill I return to this particular store?  Perhaps in the future I might. Will I purchase another pair of shoes from an outlet, I really can't say. What I do know is I am in awe with the way my feet feel on a daily basis. I have also come to see that these shoes have lasted longer than the other brand I usually purchase. I will be investing in Skechers again. The prices are reasonable, the quality is great as far as I am concerned. Perhaps my discount Skechers were just of low quality.  Tis why they were on the cheap side?!? \n\nAs for those discounted Skechers I left them at the store in LV.

(I think I'm paranoid...)\n\nWhich is why the Network Orange / ING Direct Caf\u00e9 (across from the Eaton Centre) is an interesting experiment. Despite all appearances this spot isn't a bank. They do have a couple of ABMs and the staff will field some questions if you happen to be a customer but there is nothing here you can't do at home via online banking.\n\nInstead, this place is touted as a space to hang out, grab a coffee, use some free Wifi and chill. It's a large space, though seating isn't abundant or that conducive to work. It is pretty though: they have soft leather couches, and a bar covered with iPads if you want to browse. There is lots of light and natural light, a garden wall, and copious amounts of orange if you're into that sort of thing. I'd recommend the street-facing bar if you brought your own laptop, and there is a single booth IF you get to it first.\n\nIt's not a typical coffeeshop. For starters, there is no cash register so you can only pay with debit or credit. There is no counter so just look for someone wearing an orange shirt. The coffee is supplied by Merchants of Green Coffee (bonus!), and there are pastries by LPK's Culinary Groove.  Also unique about this spot: 100% of the proceeds from sales go to a charitable organization. On my visit it was the Canadian Red Cross Disaster Relief Fund.\n\nOn the second floor are collaborative spaces available for a fee. Presumably this is how they afford their rent at Yonge and Shuter. You can rent seminar rooms, their projector and screen and other presentation tools. I will likely never use this space, but it is a cool idea.\n\nConsidering I am the only non-staff member here on a Sunday afternoon it remains to be seen how this caf\u00e9-by-a-bank will fare.

Two flour tortilla taco's with pico, slaw, some fries and taco sauce. This was great, probably my favorite menu item thus far. Everything was good though, some things better than others. My favorites were probably the shrimp, the taco's and the catfish. They use this great seasoning on everything (I beleive), the fries and meat included. It really added a lot to the fries and made them super yummy. The cole slaw was declicious. I like how they include a side of hot sauce in every order.

I sort of blundered into watching a slice of this event as I emerged from the Penn & Teller Theater after their show near 11:00 p.m., and ran into a steady stream of intently focused, mostly backpack-carrying men in their 20s and 30s in all manner of dress, and a few women, swiftly moving into the Rio's Convention Center, where 300 poker tables have been set out to accommodate tournament entrants from over 100 countries, most of whom had to plunk down a $10,000 entry fee to play here.  I joined the deluge, and entered this cavernous room where the tables were set out.  It was only a few minutes before another session was to begin, and I was lucky to secure one of only a few seats that had been placed for spectators near the tables.  As tables filled up and the cards began to be professionally dealt, at first I watched the action from a distance from my perch.  But then I recognized one well-known professional player with a reported $10,000,000 in past poker tournament winnings already under his belt, and saw where he sat down.  And, when I noticed that spectators were freely allowed to stand behind players in banded off areas, I joined in for a much closer look.  Thus I was able to stand directly behind Gus Hansen, affectionately known in poker circles as \"the Great Dane,\" and watch him play a few hands with a full table of players before I opted to buy some nice souvenirs and head for home.  I noted that other players seemed to be a bit intimidated by Mr. Hansen, and quickly folded their hands when he made an aggressive chip raise.  But he did not bully his opponents, immediately tossing his cards away after the first round of dealing multiple times.  Except for flopping over cards to seek contested chip piles, while cards dealt to players were not visible to onlookers as is often the case on TV, it was still interesting to see the interaction and moves of the players, most of whom nervously rearranged their piles of chips or repeatedly manipulated a few chips during the course of a hand.  And, ultimate decision making by the players I watched was mostly reflective, methodical, and slow.  \n\nThe tournament itself appears to be very well organized and professionally run, and poker media and spectator friendly.  I didn't see any signs forbidding photography, but only observed cameras being operated by crediential-wearing professional cameramen.  I definitely recommend that all amateur poker enthusiasts come out to the Rio even if only for a little while, and watch the \"big boys\" play at this year's WSOP.

My in-laws very nicely offered to buy us a recliner for a Christmas present, and they highly recommended La-Z-Boy as a durable, comfortable brand that would last a long time.\n\nWe scouted a store out and found one in North Olmstead.  Now I should say that in any place like this you will get bombarded by salespeople as soon as you walk through the door. I hate that, but I understand.  It's just that I don't feel like having someone watch me sit on 15 different chairs.  It's uncomfortable.\n\nNeedless to say, that happened, and the woman who assigned herself to us was a quirky, friendly, helpful salesperson.  She did kind of go overboard in asking us some personal questions, but she wanted us to be prepared \"should we ever expand our family\" or \"should our animal ever emit bodily fluids on the material.\"  Apparently, any bodily fluids, rips, tears, or stains are covered by warranty so long as you call within 2 days and you actually know what the stain is (if you don't, they won't cover it).  OK!  Maybe we'll just throw some plastic over the thing whenever we go near it.\n\nShe convinced us to buy a chair, but did NOT succeed in having us spend an additional $400 on a chair-side table (I'll take my $19 table from Target, thank you very much).  She was so hyped up by the end because she was trying to tell us when the chair would be in (it was out of stock and they had to order the specific design we wanted).  We told her there was no rush, especially because it is technically a Christmas present which is a while away.  No no no, she needed it there fast.  \"Hey! It can be there probably Thursday! And you don't need HIM (pointing to my husband) to come with ya.  You can just bring a friend.  It's not heavy.  Or the guys can put it in the car for ya.\"  Etc. etc.  I was sooo on salesperson overload at this point that I kept eating jolly ranchers from the bowl on her counter and zoning out.\n\nWe got a call that it was in and we asked if we could pick up on Saturday.  Great!  But when we got there....nope, not our chair.  It was the same \"make\" but not the same design.  After explaining this to two different people in the garage who seemed clueless, we had the manager come out and talk to us, and then I had to walk through the back garage (holding the hatchback thingie of my car) and actually point to the chair in the store as well as the fabric itself that I had spent an hour doing the previous week.  And he still didn't seem to get it.\n\nThen our saleswoman appeared.  She kept apologizing, which I guess was sincere, and she said \"My last day is Friday, and I think in the 2 years I've been working here this has only happened ONE OTHER TIME!\"  I don't care!\n\nShe said there were two options that she saw.  One: we go pick up the chair from Middleburg Heights right then.  Or two: she goes \"on my time -- and I totally don't mind doing this\" to get it and bring it back to the North Olmstead store on Monday and we can pick it up there.\n\nNow up until this point I was slightly amused and a bit aggravated, but now I was getting pissed.  Neither of those options really make things easier for us.  Either we'd have to drive out to Middleburg OR we'd have to drive BACK here next week.  Plus, what kind of a person would I be if I had actually said that I think she should go and get it when she's not working?  It would have made me the bad guy.  I should have just said, \"Or how about option three: you have it shipped to our apartment free of charge?\"  It's times like this that I just wish I had a pair of cojones.\n\nWe decided to just get it ourselves.  We went to the other place and were out of there within 5 minutes.  I think I might just give the other place 5 stars that very reason.\n\nBy the way, the chair rocks.

Since she was so cold to me with little interest in helping me out, I've lost interest in looking for a different size and simply wanted to return the item.

The thought of something tasty danced in my mind without the trouble of dealing with a true sit-down establishment.  \n\nBut where to eat?\n\nWe were heading back from the Jarry metro station and we knew that another rainstorm was just over the horizon as the hunger pangs started to roar like a Hemi engine...not roaring, more like laughing in the face of all those hybrid engines like the star football player laughed at the nerdy drama freaks in high school.  Yes, that was the sound of the struggle in my stomach as the roaring grew louder and like a junkie I was almost ready to eat anything within arms reach just to satiate the urge.\n\nWe passed a Deli...nope...not feeling it.\n\nPassed an Italian place...no grazie.\n\nAlmost to the street where the non-A/C apartment lay, we saw it with a bright blue background and reddish-orange letters, \"Ogo Sushi\".  OMG...S f'ing Ushi!!!  \"YES YES YEEEEEEES!!\" were the words in my head in that loud resounding Meg Ryan faking an orgasm voice...Yes, it had to be sushi.\n\nFrom the street, Ogo Sushi looked like a small little room with just four tables and a counter.  Despite the small humble demeanor we headed inside to check out the offerings.  The staff happily greeted us and soon brought us a menu and some water for us as we pondered on what tasty seafood treats would be part of well deserved dinner choices.\n\nEverything on the Ala Carter menu was in French and I used the larger menu as a guide with the few English words describing the various offerings.  I ordered the following items:\n\nOh hell, I have no idea as they were all in French and all I remember in between the ear splitting roars of hunger were, \"Thank sounds tasty, check the check box FAT BOY!!\"\n\nUpon turning over our order to one of the very happy servers, the sushi chef started busily working on fulfilling my dreams of a great sushi dinner.  All the time various people came in and out placing orders to go or picking up orders placed earlier.  It seemed as if this little sushi joint had its loyal fans that knew exactly what to order and from the steady number of people, I knew the food was tasty enough to keep them coming back.\n\nOur food arrived and we dove into food like a pack of wild hyenas.  Fish, roe, rice and dried seaweed flew from the sides our mouths as we stuffed our faces via chopstick power until the beautiful sushi plate before us was completely gone.  Some of the rolls ordered had an amazing blend of flavor and texture with unexpectedly fabulous crunchiness courtesy of toasted panko bread crumbs.\n\nThe most overwhelming thing about everything we ate; freshness.  Everything tasted incredibly fresh, from the fish, to the rice to the veggies.  Our entire meal was top top top, truly the highest quality with flavor that was surprising for such an unassuming Montreal neighborhood.\n\nOnce the plate of sushi before us was gone, with little more than trace pieces of pickled ginger hanging on the side of the serving dish, we did the unbelievable....we ordered another round of the exact SAME thing!\n\nThe girl at the counter happily took my order and the chef nodded in approval when I told him, \"Everything was AMAZING!  We loved every single item and I want more!\"  The chef was honored and thanked me and soon got to work on my gluttonous 2nd order.\n\nFive minutes later and the 2nd order was ready.  The waitress happily pointed out that the chef had provided us with a complimentary veggie roll and said, \"he hopes you enjoy it.\"\n\nWow!  I felt like a special client and I guess the kind words before revealing my glutenous self truly made him happy.  The complimentary roll was delicious and was made up of a blend of finely julienned veggies with a crunchy tempura zucchini in the middle.  SO tasty!!\n\nI was so happy at all of the choices and when I went to pay the bill, was ASTOUNDED that the two platoons of sushi we had just destroyed only cost us $68 Canadian dollars.  Even better!\n\nI'm sure I'll be able to talk the family into trying out Ogo Sushi again before we have to head back south to our humble abode....ummm Ogo Sushi!\n\nFINAL NOTE:  Sadly, Ogo Sushi doesn't serve alcohol...but you won't miss out with such great sushi.

I think I have literally seen people DIE in line and have the staff from the hospital across the street come to wheel them away still clutching their ghetto poison in their hands.\n\nI will be honest. The neighborhood around where I live does not attract the glitteratti, the posh, or the newly minted moneied... however that doesn't mean that there aren't some here. I love to see them in this market along with the large amount of riff raff that we have here in Las Vegas (why is that by the way).\n\nI find the most awesome deals on staples in cans, boxes, and baggies here. Booze pricing is alright but beer selection tends to lean towards the gangster (lean). This one is for me, this one is for my dead homies who were arrested and/or shot in the raid on the grow house at the Country Club just behind the store.\n\nThe main thrust and issue I have isn't that this is a low income bastion... the REAL issue I have is just how slow the service is... in fact to call it service is a DISSERVICE. SPEED UP THE CHECK OUT PROCESS!\n\nWe have a joke in my household that you can't just run to Dollar General Market... you can run there but you will be far older when you return.

Creo que he visto literalmente personas mueren en l\u00ednea y contar con el personal del hospital al otro lado de la calle llegan a la rueda a la basura sin soltar su veneno ghetto en sus manos.\n\nVoy a ser honesto.

They seriously just got 4 new customers after a visit to the Concord Mills exit!! We're sold!! I'd first like to thank Nikki & Hilary for the amazing job they did putting this event together. And Hillary running around like a chicken with her head cut off trying to keep everyone happy! Yelpers can be a lot to handle and I think she did an amazing job considering because there was a lot going on! I felt guilty sometimes asking her for something. There were a few times she forgot to do something she said she'd do, like explaining the sauces, but we would nicely reminder her and she was so sweet about helping us. Maybe they should have had more than one representative out there? Though, the waitress that she had helping was very nice as well. She ran around like crazy too and helped us a bunch! Very friendly people!! \n\nWhen Nikki says come SUPER hungry, I know this will not be our typical sampling event where you may still leave hungry, it was clear that this event was different and it did not disappoint. Fries, 11 sauces, Chicken Tenders, Chicken Nuggets, a Chicken Sandwich, a fried Turkey Sandwich (Where they do that at?! This was my FAV), Zucchini Fries, Salad, Slaw, Apples soaked in pineapple juice (Now I will be doing this at home to not only add flavor but keep my apples fresher longer), Toffee Dip, cookies, Milk shakes and the best fountain drink machine ever... and Hilary explaining everything that came out and letting us know just what PDQ is all about ALONG with an awesome kitchen tour by Terrance!!! I don't think this event had a chance to go wrong. My favorite part, though the food was amazing, was the kitchen tour. It really made me fall in love with the restaurant even more. Hearing how passionate terrance and hilary are about this place and knowing just how fresh everything is and how dedicated PDQ is to their original plan and their support of local product. Coming here won't make me feel as guilty on my cheat days lol. The Chef even came out at one point and made a round to make sure everyone was ok. Mainly to the every day diners, but I thought that was a big deal. When an event is going on, other diners can feel ignored. So I appreciated that even though it wasn't for me. \n\nI saved my cookie that night to enjoy the next day because I was so stuffed. I even hid it from my mom so I could enjoy it alone... don't judge me... she's spoiled enough please believe. It was still fresh and moist the next day. How many basic chicken fast food restaurants have you been to that seasons their food as well as PDQ?? I know for me that count is at zero!

Anything less than a stellar review is disrespectful to Nikki & to the event staff who put so much thought and time into these events. We're an extension of our fearless leader, so let's make her look as good as possible to the Charlotte businesses that donate so much FREE food, event space & time to us.**\n\nNow-obviously, we all Yelp because we love food. But this event was more than that -- it was a learning experience as well. Terrance, the GM, gave us a very detailed kitchen tour & walk through. I expected it to be quick and dull, because once you've seen one kitchen you've seen them all, right? WRONG. This kitchen has no freezer, nor a microwave. So you know everything is f-r-e-s-h to death. Terrance walked us through the steps of how they make all the food, including the TEN (yes 1-0) hour process of making their amazingly delicious hand-cut french fries.  Even the sauces are made in-house daily ... that doesn't happen at ANY other fast food chain I know of. That's both awesome and sad news... because I fell in love with the Creamy Garlic sauce and I'll never to able to buy it by the jar to take home. Terrance also taught us the difference between a chicken 'tender' & a chicken 'strip'. I honestly thought they were the same interchangeable name .. but now I know. TENDERS 4 LIFE. \n\nOn to the food, or should I say smorgasbord, that PDQ offered up. Upon arriving, they had a few salads out to get us started, as well as their (house made) dressings. The Cesar is ah-may-zing ... just go with it. Instead of doing a buffet line, they wanted everything out fresh for us. The gracious Hillary (their marketing guru) acted as the groups one-woman server,  bringing out those tasty treats table by table. \n\nRound one: ALL THE SAUCES (literally) & a basket of fries. so. many. sauces. night made.\nRound two: their new Cali-Club sandwich (this this was dynamite)\nRound three: zucchini fries .. my weakness. awesome, as expected. \nRound four: TENDER TIME. \nRound five: Nuggets for everyone (move over chick-fil-a, these are chickie-nugs)\nRound six: apples (soaked in pineapple juice) & this heavenly toffee nut dip\nRound seven: fried turkey sandwich (graciously made per our special request)\nRound eight: COOKIES for everyone. Also baked in house\nRound nine: Milkshakes. & not just any, REALLY good milkshakes. PB&choc FTW.\n\nWhoa, writing that just made me realize how much I ate and that Nikki needs to plan a fit club event just to burn off all the carbs. Kudos to Hillary for personally serving all NINE rounds of food to each table, and taking the time to explain and chat as she went. Not an easy task when you've got ~50 hangry foodies chomping at the bit. \n\n3-Cheers to Nikki & all of the PDQ staff for putting on an awesome event & showing the Yelp squad how a true fast-casual restaurant should operate. \n\nPS --- OPEN A PDQ IN UPTOWN/SOUTHEND/SOUTHPARK AREA ASAP, because it's now one of my favorite fast casual chains.", "business_id": "Fi6bDnkSJANkDYR0BuFPPg", "stars": 5, "date": "2016-05-26", "useful": 5, "type": "review", "cool": 4}, {"funny": 3, "user_id": "tBldrCI2KDA_WfYNloHqsA", "review_id": "BKxL1ZayAyM4Xj2xa13_tQ", "text": "I was starving.

Well, in my case, it was solely to answer that question...\n\nHonest to god, I do not know what i'm doing with my eyebrows. I have a little gel sticky thing that I occasionally smush through them and I can pluck the odd hair that is out of place, but shaping/filling/anything remotely close to complicated... I'm at a loss. Thankfully, my brows grow SO SLOWLY, that I can get away with a wax every 6 months and a cheapo at home tint (because blonde eyebrows and black hair looks silly).\n\nSo while I was making the rounds looking for my yearly brow tidy, I found Zen with its 5 star following and the elusive HD Brows. I poked around the internet a bit and couldn't seem to find anything that truly explained WHY HD Brows cost so much more... sure there's a big pitch about 7 different methods, yada yada, but honestly, it didn't seem THAT much fancier than a simple wax/tint. But seeing as though I am brow clueless and again, only have to bite the bullet and actually pay attention to them once/twice a year, I booked.\n\n... and damnit, I'm going to be the gal who spends \u00a338 to get her brows done again.\n\nThe \"magic\" of this brow method is really just paying better attention. The gal who did mine cleaned up the top, adjusted the tint twice, waxed, threaded and generally fine tooth combed my brows. The most useful part was afterwards, she walked me through how to fill the sparse bits and I actually might wield that brow pencil with a little more purpose now. The big money making difference: I have eyebrows that look like I actually care about that fact. It was a, \"Oh THAT'S what they're supposed to look like\" moment.\n\nHow about the location? The place is bright, clean and the folks are cheerful. It's easy to book (online, in person or over the phone) and they have ridiculously late hours for a spa type spot (open until 10pm on the weekdays!!). \n\nFinal verdict? I don't think i'd be an HD brow gal if I had to do it with any regularity, but I was impressed enough to return in a few months when they get out of hand. Even if you have to wax/tidy every few weeks, it might be worth flinging this into the mix once or twice a year.

She's always punctual, sends email or phone call reminders and is as gentle or forceful as you ask her to be. If you are new to massage therapy and intimidated by having a stranger touch you, I can't recommend her highly enough as the person to see. There's nothing scary or embarrassing here, and she's trained in many types of massage so there's surely something to suit your needs, whether it's a post-marathon rubdown, working out a strange and sudden kink in your neck or general spa-like bliss.\n\nSophi's touch is magical and I dare you to not fall asleep during one of her thigh-quiveringly delightful massages. In fact, we have joked that she could easily only spend 10 minutes on the massage, let me sleep for 40 minutes, and then wake me up at the end, and I'd be none the wiser. That's how relaxing our time together is.\n\nI suffer from chronic migraines as well as being a stomach sleeper (a terrible thing) and I can't tell you how beneficial massage therapy has been in curbing my migraines and soothing my neck tension.\n\nIf you have benefits through your employer and aren't taking advantage of the massage portion, you should be ashamed of yourself!

I found an new oasis on Queen Street only steps away from the Drake and the Gladstone and the plethora of the usually seen and wannabe seen places that litter the cusp of Parkdale. This is my kinda place. I just want to carve my name into one of their stools and take up residence. Just so you know, a double deuce is a glass of something off the beer tap chased by a shot of hard core booze. The DD lists a blackboard of double deuce combo's, that they refer to as \"breakfasts\" guaranteed to kill whatever sorrow you came in to drown. The combo's are ten bucks....with the exception of the East Coast Breakfast which is a glass of Keith's followed by a punch in the head, that special is twenty five bucks. :) How can you not love a bar where this kind of wry (or in this case, rye) humour abounds. \n\nDea, my FARC sista, and I were in serious need of libations and consolation so we huddled up at the bar last night and whacked back some cocktails and chowed down on some of the best bar food we've had in ages. At the end of the bar, in a space about 5' x 5' a chef/cook fills all the food orders. When was the last time you saw a basket of gorgeous, ripe, delicious heirloom tomatoes in a bar? While swilling our booze our schnozes were filled with the heavenly scent of grilling cheese sandwiches (aged cheddar!) and percolating chili. There are small cheese boards ($8 bucks), meat boards and a decent hummos & olives & crostini board. We opted to share a brisket sandwich that was mmmmmmmmmmmm inspiring. Brisket topped with melted aged cheddar, piled with caramelized onions and heirloom tomatoes and sided with some tortillas chips & salsa. \n\nThe taps at the DD are really decent from Okanagan Springs to Grasshopper, glasses range from $5.50 to $7.50. The tunes rock from Bob Marley to The Clash, as Dea and I sang along (how can you not sing along to Bob Marley?). The staff are so laid back but on top of the comings and goings of their patrons.

I'm an animal lover, and a great part about living here was the dog feces and throw up commonly found in the elevator. That weird smell in the hallway? It's just because people here like to hoard far too many animals in their 1000 square foot apartment. Speaking of animals, their apartments come with your very own cockroaches!! I always wanted an animal of my own and when I found my first cockroach in my bathroom, well I was so excited. But believe me there were more to come!! Under my bed, in the kitchen, the closets, everywhere! \nI love the environment and when I see that the trash shoot is commonly overflowing with dirty garbage, I know people are doing their part to keep our earth clean of waste.  They also don't provide recycling services which is really just an added convenience. We all know recycling is terrible for mother earth! \nDon't ever be bothered by the leasing office here because no staff is ever there! Have a question or an issue with one of the shitty appliances in your apartment? Don't worry about it! They don't care so neither should you! Garbage disposals are such a first world luxury anyway. If you ever want to pick up a package you ordered, you may just never see it, but it's probably for the best. Did you really even need that Amazon order? Probably not!\nAnother thing I love? Art. Art is in all forms at 1005 west trade. They did a marvelous job with the beautiful clusters of mold forming around all of the air vents! I would stare up at my ceiling at night and think, \"This must be just like the Sistine Chapel.\" Then I'd wake up with a sore throat from breathing it in all night and have a great excuse to call out of work with the sinus infections I got from it.

And look, you saved a whole trip to the Salvation Army!\nThe low income housing tax break they receive provides a diverse community in the complex, and if you're hankering for a drug fix, the hallways commonly smell strongly of weed, so strongly in fact that you don't even need to smoke it yourself. Just keep breathing it in!  This place is great for families who want a short life expectancy for their children. Sometimes people in the complex like to play a fun game and walk around the hallways and try to find apartment doors that were left unlocked to see who they can rob. It leaves you on the edge of your seat! So fun!!\nAll of the window locks were broken in our apartment when we moved in but who needs to lock windows anyway? Let that natural city air in and the sound of SO MUCH TRAFFIC OUTSIDE YOUR DOOR!  You won't ever get a full nights sleep again, but sleep is for the weak! You're near a Starbucks, so you should be fine.\nAh the winter time.  Who doesn't just crave a nice hot cup of cocoa followed by iceskating on the front steps of your building?  At 1005, they don't trouble themselves with salting or shoveling, because that would be such a waste of a naturally made rink!

At first when we walked in the restaurant was completely empty and I got a little worried (I mean after all it was 7:30... not an unusual time for most people to be eating dinner...) but needless to say that by the time we left the restaurant was full of people. It was nice though because for the 20 minutes we had the place all to ourselves.\n\nWe ordered the lamb loin to start and it was SCRUMPTIOUS... we all inhaled in in like 10 sec. and the roasted tomatoes were done on the vine which I thought made them even better and sweeter.... Would totally order it again though the portion of the lamb was a bit skimpy... but then again that's one of my large critiques for the whole restaurant - that the portions were really small and that there wasn't much meat for cost... which is a no no in my book and thus -1 *.\n\nFor dinner I ordered the Monkfish which I would have to say though beautifully cooked had an extremely disappointing sauce. The sauce almost tasted like mulled wine and while I applaud the chef for thinking outside the box... any sauce that tastes like mulled wine just does not fly. Also, the monkfish just sat there on the plate with nothing under it or no vegetable of any kind which I though was extremely embarrassing and that it goes against one of the fundamental rules of plating when it comes to food.\n\nDespite this shortcoming the sweet potato fries that I ordered where absolutely AMAZING and I loved them and in fact I could make a meal out of them. Thus solidifying the 4 star rating.\n\nFor desert I had sticky toffee pudding and it was absolutely AMAZING too. \n\nNeedless to say I would totally go back.

If you don't want to read it, the moral of this story if you decide to go there is: Confirm the prices as you book the appointment, and whatever it says on the website, ignore it.\n\nI accompanied a friend to get her hair cut.  The hairdresser gave a decent cut, the owner stepped in to resolve the issue, but the receptionist (cashier) was a total nightmare. Although it was not my haircut, I became involved in the issue because the she was being rude, unprofessional and lied to my friend. It was appalling and this situation was alarming enough to write this review to make sure it wouldn't happen to someone else.\n\nI met her while she was getting her hair cut, because we were going to have a coffee after. The stylist did a decent cut on her, maybe could have tried styling it different, but it was ok. The problem started after he had led her to the reception to pay. After he walked away, we were standing there and after punching in the total, she says to my friend that will be $89. \n\nThe issue: my friend did research online from the salon website, the services section showed ranking of stylists ( junior, senior, or master) and range of prices. My friend has a pixie cut short hair so she wanted a decent cut, but the master price which said $60+ was not what she wanted. The Senior pricing stated $45-60 on the site, so called to make an appointment for the same day, 1st time customer. The receptionist asked which level, and she replied senior stylist, and appt was for 430pm. My friend then let me know how excited she was and the price was in her range, and the salon was near my work.  \n\nWhat earned the single star here, was 100% about attitude from the receptionist. After letting my friend know about the price, it startled her, because that was not at all what she expected. The receptionist apologized but said she couldn't do anything about it. My friend said that when she called in, she had requested the senior stylist, and then quoted the website prices. \n\nReceptionist explained again that she couldn't change that. She then proceeded to say, what am I supposed to do, make the stylist lose money? I then said, and my friend is supposed to pay for the mistake by whichever person booking the appt? She said there was no mistake, the stylist is a senior stylist. So I inquired why is his price higher than a senior stylist? She then said, I don't know why, but I know his price is $89 for the cut. Then she said besides, the prices are wrong on the website, it's really old and its too difficult to change the prices. (Disclosure: my friend happens to be a art director in web design) So at that point my friend is baffled, because this still isn't her fault, yet this receptionist is not making any exceptions. The receptionist claimed that there was a disclaimer on the website (ps as of tonight there is not, and I took a screenshot of their pricing)\n\nThen she goes on to say, and by the way, Pure is a high-end salon, our masters charge over $100, if you wanted a $20 haircut you shouldn't have come here. It was this condescending remark that wishes they should get 0 stars. My friend was almost going to pay it to just get out of the situation, but I couldn't let that happen. I asked again if there was someone in charge that we could speak to, she said no. I said that this needs to be resolved. The receptionist continued to say that my friend should have verified the pricing when she called in and asked for a senior stylist, suggesting that it was her responsibility to double check the pricing. My friend replied that if she is reading it on the website, she didn't see the need to. \n\nAt the end of this story, who I imagine as the owner, came out and told the receptionist to not charge her, took my friend by the hand and apologized, while the receptionist was giving details to him like our website prices are old right? She didn't confirm the pricing on the phone with us... my friend then explained the situation very clearly, she is not unhappy with the haircut, she just didn't expect to be charged that much and had she known the actual price, she wouldn't have asked for that. She told the owner, she was willing to pay $60 as a compromise. He said that it would be taken care of, but she said she is fine with paying that. so the receptionist took her card, charged her the money, and offered no apology for her condescending comments. \n\nFor the owner and the stylist: my friend would have given them many more stars, but for the overall experience, she said she definitely won't be going back there, even though they resolved it.", "business_id": "E8zpGiYERqkN-FMhq0bPIg", "stars": 1, "date": "2012-08-10", "useful": 23, "type": "review", "cool": 2}, {"funny": 3, "user_id": "3vGiPNH4yCAj88-kfdvbjw", "review_id": "LoctGRwIWX1dSBiA-SHLLg", "text": "I went to Salon Pure on a whim due to some of the reviews I'd heard.

I have no idea why, other than it had a pretty campus, but everything else fell flat for me there. It just wasn't the school for me. I was looking for a warm, social environment with great professors and ratings. So I transferred and found that at BW! (And yes, I went there when it was BWC, not this University stuff they have going on now... but I digress.) \n\nOverall, I had a complete and utter blast in college (met my very best friend!), which was exactly what I wanted. The broadcasting dept. was just getting started with their TV program, BuzzTV and my advisor got me right into higher level journalism classes I couldn't get into at JCU (mostly because they didn't even have a good broadcasting program there when I went.) It was nice to get right into classes that actually had something to do with my dream career. \n\nAdditionally the professors didn't waste any time telling us exactly what it was going to be like \"out there,\" which gave me a much better idea of what I was getting myself into. The few liberal arts classes I did have to take were MY CHOICE--which was refreshing. Like, in my case, I didn't want to take a foreign language so I had the option of taking some pretty sweet history/religion courses that fulfilled those requirements. I absolutely could not get enough of these courses, especially since I got to choose one of my favorite profs. \n\nThe housing, food, and meal card situation was pretty nice--especially since surrounding restaurants accepted our meal cards. The bookstore had tons of electronics which sort of chiseled away at my food funds, but whatever. The books themselves can get pricey and there's no off-campus stores that offer used books--so that sucked. They did offer a buyback program that only half raped you, so that was nice. \n\nParking would be one of my only gripes, but when is that ever really nice unless you're an upper classman? Just watch out for those pesky campus parking tickets... lol. Plus, the campus is relatively small and the buildings are all within close walking distance. \n\nGreek life (I know I'm losing half of you here) was awesome. I loved the social aspect and you can't beat the Alpha Phis! Clearly I was interested in more of the social aspect of school... but I did maintain my grades and even made it to some classes (probably hungover, but who's judging?)\n\nThings I wish I would have spent more time with: The Career Department. I just didn't hear much about it when I was there and it looked so small--but I hear from other folks that it's actually pretty good. For me? It didn't help--I only made like 2 visits. I was still stuck in the mindset that I was going to become a reporter right out of college... HAHAHAHAHAHAHA! #fail \n\nThen again, I have a much better job now than I could have ever imagined.

Have a sip at the Armitage wine bar, enjoy some creative sushi at Blue Wasabi, get decent (not going to blow your socks off, but will satisfy your craving) Mexican food at San Felipe, buy some pretty flowers for your lady at the Bloom Room, get groovy with live music in the bar at Eddie V's, and attend the family oriented events at DC if you're apart of the NoSco community.

From the minute I enter until the minute I leave, I feel like I'm in pleasantville. Everything about DC Ranch is clean, cute and comfortable. From the houses to the market street, everything is top notch. \n\nOver the years, DC Ranch has taken a little turn. What started as the all-in-one community equipped with nightlife, day-life and living essentials, has transformed into more of a community without so much of the nightlife -- and I think that's a good thing. \n\nI will begin with Market Street. This is the area that has transformed over the years and with it, the nightlife style bars have vanished. I think this has allowed DC Ranch to turn into more of a homey community rather than the next Old Town. Several restaurants still line the streets, and very popular ones at that. On of my favorite wine bars is still there and there are several boutique retail stores. It's a nice shopping area to walk around on a weekend. \n\nNow moving on to DC ranch, the community. The houses in DC Ranch are like little castles. The architecture is pretty and the houses are private and in a community at the same time. Within the community, residents have a \"club\" equipped with a pool, playground, tennis courts and community area. This is perfect for families and makes it a community with real neighbors. Each section is behind gates as well. \n\nI think that DC Ranch is a great option for a family with small children who want to live in a safe and enclosed area.", "business_id": "E8fCJiZyCBTWdTe2YR_uWg", "stars": 5, "date": "2011-04-06", "useful": 4, "type": "review", "cool": 4}, {"funny": 4, "user_id": "7G_3LVHXMlpGLPMDQ_hthQ", "review_id": "6LRwck7cfcqbaIKhjOXfyA", "text": "I've been coming here since I moved to north town, ten yrs.

What? Cartoons have needs too. \n\nTo detail my dream (because I know y'all are into that kinda thing--this is the internet, after all) I'll start from the beginning... \n\nI'm the headline guest on the Late Show with David Letterman while Bill Murray is the supporting guest, meaning he goes out to interview first. When Bill's alotted interview time is over, he doesn't clear off stage and instead the show's producers decide to go back to the old late-night talk show format where the first guest just moves down a seat and listens while the new guest (me) comes on and sits in the seat nearest Dave. So while the interview would focus primarily on me, Bill could still (potentially) bounce some jokes from across the couch. \n\nOkay, so that's the basic setting for the dream, then I come out and the audience cheers and Dave stands to come over and great me as I walk up the stage stairs. Then Bill stands up from the first guest seat to give me the usual hug and professional acquaintance kiss on each cheek (which would be a total ruse since there'd most likely be a fiery sexual tension burning from both our loins), then as I turn to the audience to do the standard wave to fans and smoothing of my skirt before sitting in the hot seat, Bill pulls some typical BM shenanigans and jokingly sits back down in the first guest seat instead of moving over, leaving me no option but to do an 'Oh Bill, you silly goose' face with a bit of blushing and as the audience thinks I'll let the joke play out, Bill will politely get up and I'll take my seat, BUT instead I play into the humor and take the very unladylike seat on Mr Bill Murray's lap. Dave does his usual squeaky laugh and makes a joke about getting comfortable; I might make a joke while pretending I don't know that I'm actually sitting on Bill about the chair being a 'little stiff' (if the censors approve) then a laugh track would play, Paul Schaefer would signal for the 'a joke just happened' drum/symbols, Bill would make a 'Hey man, I'm only human' facial expression and we'd continue on. \n\nI'd imagine Bill might take charge of my end of the interview, interjecting and acting as my handler of sorts and answering questions in my place as how he thinks I would answer them while I make corrections and BM would then say that what I said is what he actually meant to say and so on. \n\nAt some point my hair (which will be big, bountiful and Bardot-esque with my full weave snapped in) gets in Bill's mouth a bit while I'm turning my head back and forth to Dave and Bill, whose lap I'm still sitting on. Dave points out the 'hairy situation' Bill's gotten himself into and Bill says something to the tune of it not being so bad and my hair being really soft and luxurious against his skin and that he bets it'd be a treat to run his hands through, as he gently nestles his fingers into my long, luscious orange locks. Naturally, this piques Dave's interest as he'd also like to have a feel of my mane, so he asks if he 'may' and I of course oblige. Then a few moments pass and the audience is eating it up while Dave and Bill are just loving touching my hair- so much so that Dave motions to stage hands that he needs two brushes STAT! Because nothing would please him more than being able to brush my hair. The brushes arrive, they both continue to chatter and soak up all the Candice G hair brushing they can, even bypassing the regularly scheduled top ten list and substituting with their own top ten of why Candice G is so wonderful with supporting reasons being things like, 'because Candice is so charming', 'because Candice hair was rated 5-stars on Yelp', 'because we love Candice'... etc, etc, they don't have to make sense, this is my dream and I can paint it however I choose. \n\nThe show ends with Alan Kalter basically having to cut in and sign out for Dave since he, much like Bill, is still so enthralled in brushing my hair. There's also no musical guest since the sound of smooth brush strokes and careful whispers between the three of us are music enough. And of course there's more to the dream than just that but a girl's gotta keep some sh*t private, right? \n\nAaaanyway... Thanks to the magic of GelaSkins, a contest held by my boss and a cornucopia of #Winning, I can have a little bit of that dream on a daily basis in the form of my custom MacBook GelaSkin with just the most beautiful image you've ever seen (see posted image)--a semi old-school pic of Bill Murray and David Letterman on the Late Show.

There's no web site and I wasn't near a computer so I said, \"Umm I guess two salads?\" It would have been nice to have had an extra cucumber salad or a $1.00 refund as the salad was a buck cheaper than the fish cake that I originally ordered, but alas, I did not receive one.\n\nAn hour after I placed my order, it was dropped off.

If a restaurant has 3 chili peppers on their menu next to an item, that's basically the number one selling point - even though I know I'll still have to douse whatever it is in more hot sauce.

Well priced at about $6.\n\nIt was downhill from there.\nPapaya salad had no discernible papaya in it. There was a white, shredded substance that almost appeared to be bean sprouts and had no flavor.

I had only been here to buy tennis clothes, and bring Isabelle to get her nails done once before.  This plaza is certainly anything but splendid.\n\nFirst it was the circling game...where my family circled the plaza until Isabelle's family would arrive since they were the host..but then I saw Isabelle and her mother circle the plaza...so we had to circle some more while avoiding them.  Then when we could circle no more..we found out that her Father was already inside the restaurant waiting for us.  Nobody won the arrive later game.\nWe all sat down and the parents left the ordering to us 'children', Isabelle is a learned Chinese Woman...I left China when I was nine.  I'm cultured...but not ordering off of a new menu cultured.  If you know Chinese food, you know that they all have names bestowed from the heavens..with translations from hell.  Working out what to eat was like trying to figured out which colour wire to cut in a bomb scene.  \n\nThe d\u00e9cor was dull and there were no signature giant fish tanks, but at least our table wasn't wobbly.  White cloth table linens, very simple.  We were the only significant party here, so our conversations resonated throughout the floor.  The waiters were professional and entertaining, good service overall.  The food arrived, and like cattle, I was fed by the opposite family.  Food came onto my plate as if I was five years old and wasn't capable of using chopsticks.  I guess we'll always been children until we have children ourselves.  There was a chair between me and Isabelle, and it became slightly awkward until that chair was filled by the totally unexpected arrival of Isabelle's new boyfriend from Shanghai.  Like..fresh off the boat...and now it was extremely awkward.   \n\nI guess he was good looking, charming, but above all noticeably..taller.  Let's just say it was a surprise to my family, and now the entire outcome of the evening rested upon my shoulders.  My Chinese culture went into hyper-drive and I forced out intelligent conversation like a grade 7 vinegar and baking soda experiment.  It became pleasant eventually, and we got along rather splendidly.  At one point a dish arrived, and Mr. Shanghai said: we call these 'cold dishes' in Shanghai.  \n\"Oh,\"  I replied, \"Because in Qingdao we call these....'cold dishes as well.'  He got my point and retracted.  Later I oneuped him with an ancient Chinese parable that had the whole table shoot back into their chairs.  Nothing like unexpected knowledge. =]\n\nI always end up playing host no matter what function I attend, people don't seem to understand that having drinks and food is not nearly enough to entertain guests.  But I had the situation under control this time, and the dinner went successfully.  Three hours, and not for a moment were we short on food.  The place prepared dishes quickly and well, I might come back here for lunch.  \nI think we ordered a total of 23 dishes.\n\nAt the end of the night we were on the Shanghai High, a lovely time was had by all.  The restaurant could benefit from a better location in my opinion. The family friendship lives.  Of course all of this is mumbo-jumbo if you're not familiar with Chinese dinner etiquette.  So in case of this..Hi Shanghai is a fairly well managed restaurant with decent food.  \n\nBut for me...I was just glad it was over and I would be saying Bye Shanghai instead.", "business_id": "H7_QV4LceybuWhuuIhlp_w", "stars": 3, "date": "2011-12-15", "useful": 2, "type": "review", "cool": 3}, {"funny": 3, "user_id": "CXwHjHxwGDzRTgvU_NdLIQ", "review_id": "ZQofO-khqF56cuAaIpEMBw", "text": "Why the eff are there so many little kid screaming and running around here at midnight!?!?\n\nYuck!

Our previous experience was good. We did have a problem with another tenant as did several other people living in the complex. The management took care of the problem.

Later, while throwing some of the cans in a cooler, I noticed some dried mold on the bottom of the cardboard carry - not a good sign. At the picnic, I noticed that the beer was not quite what I remembered it to be (understatement). The next day, I found the canning date to be April 14, 2009 - almost a year and a half old.\n\nI returned to Beer Minimum with the remaining two six packs today. First they tried to tell me the beer wasn't necessarily bad. Then they tried to give me two replacement six packs of the same, equally old, beer. After a few calls to the owner and some awkward conversation, the lady directed me to Vecenie's Distributor from whom Beer Minimum got the Pils. I reminded her that I got the beer from Beer Minimum. She told me that I could have purchased that beer anywhere. I told her that her computerized records will indicate that I purchased it there.\n\nOne obstacle to my return was that I did not have a receipt.

Funky Monkey loaf ($4.99, plus tax)- I suppose the cute packaging is useful in gift-giving, but I prefer the packaging treatment given to those loaves sold at Whole Foods- first wrapped in parchment paper and taped, then wrapped again in a beautiful and classy brown bag with store logo and nutritional info decals.  Granted, those loaves I buy are of the 2-lb. variety, which incidentally are currently marked up by at least $2 ($2.50, I think)!  Definitely get these at SB.

Both have great toothiness and surprisingly rich and complex favors, yet are a bit too salty, esp. the tomato.

The atmosphere is excellent.\n\nFirst-Hand Experience: More info about my personal experience at this stadium - watching a match here reminded me of seeing a game in England. Only with better food. My goodness, I would give that bridie another go at any given meal time, 7 days in a row. Absolutely delicious. It's loud in here, the fans are great, it's one of the best experiences in Scottish football. If they could pack the house a little bit more, I'd give them a 5. Also if I could mail-order those Bridies, they'd get a 6.\n\nSo when I was doing my first tour of Scotland in 2011, I also hit up every single stadium in the country. My obsession with footy (soccer to Americans) is the reason. Every stadium review - like all my reviews - are based on first-hand personal experience, usually from multiple visits. As recently as Fall 2014, when I was \"stuck\" in UK for 3 months, I went to most of them yet again while travelling. I have pictures of me at many of them, which I will post later.

Of note are the legendary Steak Bridies which are baked by Dunfermline's famous \"Stephen's the Bakers\". Pies are freshly delivered on match day, so if the football isn't up to much you can rest assured that a meaty bridie will help bring a smile to your face.\n\nAt half time you can expect to be entertained by Scotland's number 1 mascot Sammy The Tammy. His naughty pranks are legendary and his often risky antics can end up as the next days headlines. In my time I have seen Sammy construct a cardboard tank and \"aim fire\" at opposition fans, ski down one of the main stands in honour of the winter Olympics and make fun of countless managers and players.\n\nThe relatively small and compact stadium with its close proximity to the pitch can make for a great atmosphere, especially when a local rival comes to town.

Beautifully landscaped walking path.  The walking path winds through the grassy area and the desert area.  It is a lovely walk and you almost forget you are in Las Vegas.  It is so great!\n\n4.

Instead, we came up against attitude from both the waitress and the management, the steak and baked potato thrown into the garbage resulting in a 30 minute wait for the correct steak while everyone else ate.  When the Tbone finally arrived it was served with mashed potatoes because they threw the previous baked potato away and were then out. No one ordered or wanted mashed potatoes.

This place did just about everything it could think of to make me wish I never used an iphone app to find it. \n\nI went to Vegas this weekend to enjoy UFC 106 with some close friends. After Forrest Griffin made me happy I decided to top off the evening with something like The boiling Crab or the Crab hut. I used my friend's iPhone to find the nearest spot for us to indulge in some Cajun goodness. We got in a cab and hurried over to Cajun Crawfish. We arrived to find the place almost empty. We were sat and the waiter returned with our drinks. We ordered our usual and waited for about 15 minutes only to have the waiter return to our table to tell us they were out of corn on the cob....whaaaat?? ok ok ok...I can deal with that. But then we waited about another 30 minutes only to be confronted with the most flavorless crawfish and shrimp I have ever tasted in my life! Our potatoes come and they have no seasoning anywhere and are waaay undercooked. We sent the potatoes back to be cooked longer and they were still under cooked when the waiter brought them back. We ordered some steamed white rice and even that was horrible....how do you screw up rice? The sausage was undercooked, the crawfish was over cooked and lacked any flavor except spice. the shrimp was ok at best...a tad over cooked but still...ok. We tried to tell the female waitress about the potatoes and the rice only to find she doesn't speak English, so we were then stuck playing charades with the girl. After we were finished with our disaster of a dinner...we asked for wet naps. The lemon scented ones tend to cut the fishy smell out of your hands. Guess what?? No wet naps. \n\nWe agreed to call it quits for the evening and head back to the hotel. We asked the waiter to call a cab.....after asking every employee in the joint \"Do we have cab number?\" we decided to make use of the iphone once again and called our own cab. \n\nWe waited outside for our cab and noticed the sign for Cajun Crawfish stated \"Grand Opening\". Well, I don't know about \"grand\" but I guess the place is new. So here is my advice to the owners....shut down for a week and visit The Boiling Crab in LA area. Notice the flavor, the decor, the hospitable service, the flavor and the flavor or their food. Then come back to Vegas and regroup. There is no point in owning a below average establishment like this. When you have visitors that know what their food is supposed to taste like and visit your restaurant with certain expectations....they are just going to leave seriously unhappy and are going to tell all their friends about their piss poor experience. Not trying to be mean...but Cajun Crawfish is way under par. \n\nCajun Crawfish failed to deliver...in EVERY way possible. I will not go back and I will make sure that no one I care about makes the same mistake I did by going here. Waste of time, waste of money and there was a risk of food poisoning with the whole undercooked sausage thing. It's clear this place doesn't care about the quality of their food....looks like they are just happy enough to be open and have anyone walk through their doors. \n\n2 lb shrimp (1 mild and 1 medium) FAIL \n2 lb Crawfish (medium) FAIL \n12 practically raw potatoes FAIL \nno corn on the cob MAJOR FAIL \n24 undercooked sausage FAIL \n3 orders of slice bread GOOD \n2 order rice FAIL \n\nI would have been happier with Popeye's Chicken and Biscuits", "business_id": "Vm_xCBVn_Tu9P8an8N0vNQ", "stars": 1, "date": "2009-11-23", "useful": 6, "type": "review", "cool": 5}, {"funny": 6, "user_id": "XEHZoTDWjw3w-gcQyYIe4g", "review_id": "DY5a1_UJNOT8TvEere9h8w", "text": "It's been almost 2 years since I've been here. the fact that they're still open is a good sign.

The truth is that consumers like Yelp because it allows us to seek honest evaluations of stores and restaurants in advance of a purchase, saving us from having to wager our hard-earned money on an unknown experience -- whether or not that wager is on an indie or corporate business (my money does all spend alike.) It also gives us a voice, so that we can share opinions we think are valuable with other consumers. \n\nWhat business-owners like about Yelp is that it is a meritocracy; good reviews and good establishments float to the top, as the aggregate of responses gradually eliminates outliers. Your business has 4-stars. That means that there is a good chance that my negative experience(s) are just those very types of outliers, the weight of which decrease over time.\n\nIn light of this reality, it probably would have been better for you to either ignore my review, or else respond with only this section: \"It sounds like my employees may need a refresher on how to make crispy, chewy, gooey grilled cheese sandwiches to my specifications, which I am happy to do. Know this, my number one goal as the proprietor of MELTED is to make sure that my customers leave satisfied and come back for more. If we are failing in this regard, then we need to step up our game.\" \n\nInstead, you alternately whined and berated me, accused me of participating in a scam against local business, and swore at me. Seriously? \n\nYou claim to wish I had sought out an owner and then admitted that you aren't usually present on-site (never mind the fact that carts are grab-and-go, and if something goes wrong with an order during the weekday lunch rush, the customer isn't likely to know until they're already back at work.) \n\nYou accused me of not caring about your business and not understanding the subject at hand, while conveniently ignoring that this was not my first disappointing experience at your cart. \n\nYour response was a roller coaster ride of invective and bad customer service that bizarrely ended with an offer of free lunch (no thanks, you sound scary.)\n\nPlease do retrain your staff on the jalapeno popper sandwich; the one I had was awful. If you want to be contacted directly about bad experiences, try posting a sign to that effect with your contact information. If you're worried about supporting your family and 4 employees, don't alienate customers by attacking them. But mostly? Educate yourself about Yelp's algorithm and the culture of the review community. Attacking your reviewers was never going to be a good plan, but if it was that or nothing, had you known more about Yelp you at least might have made the wiser decision to leave the review alone and let it be buried if it was an outlier. \n\nIn the meantime, I guess I now have a crazy story to tell about your cart, instead of just the memory of a bad sandwich, which I had already nearly forgotten. Your response is a lot less forgettable than your sandwiches.", "business_id": "CYFfha5CmApflbpN1AhWHQ", "stars": 2, "date": "2016-06-02", "useful": 11, "type": "review", "cool": 5}, {"funny": 5, "user_id": "GoeHBmVr2bb395Zb74vU_w", "review_id": "h53L93ax2wjEzKbd68sEhA", "text": "So I had a grilled cheese from Melted for about the fifth or sixth time the other night and I was going to write a four-star review.

While you should definitely read it yourself, I just want to draw your attention to one line that truly buggers the imagination:\n\n\"You are not a food reviewer, you are not food critic, or a culinary expert, you don't run your own business and aren't an expert in running a mobile business. In other words, you are wholly unqualified to critique any of those things.\"\n\nThat's right, customer: You are totally unqualified to judge whether a grilled cheese was good or not. \n\nI disagree.

Considering there are 3 other Subway stores within 1km I am flabbergasted this place is still in business.\n\nWimpy's Diner - You can't blame Wimpy's Diner for looking tired, the brand itself is tired.  I have never seen more than 2 patrons inside at one time, and it extrudes an overwhelming sense of sadness whenever you walk by.\n\nSears Outlet - I would imagine I would have a bette experience if I walked into a warehouse full of stolen merchandise.  The entire Sears is dirty, unkempt, and merchandise is strewn all over without any care or structure.  The prices themselves aren't even that great, and you cannot find a single employee in the entire two levels.\n\nLotto Outlet Stand - Doesn't accept credit or debit cards.  Enough said.\n\nMilano Fashion Outlet - A large collection of cheaply made clothes.  I purchased a belt once, and it didn't last until the end of the day before it fell apart.  They sell suits for $99.  Enough said.\n\nJK Bag n' Baggage - Same as Milano, but with bags.  \n\nL & W Lingerie - Having a lingerie store that is always empty is always odd.  The fashions are straight out of the 80's, and don't look appealing in any sense.  True, I don't buy ladies underwear very often but I rarely, if ever see anyone inside this place let alone purchasing something.\n\nMarlin Travel - Why do travel agencies even exist, let alone in a brick and mortar store.\n\nRogers - The guys in here are actually quite nice.  They are a registered re-seller for Rogers.  Their inventory is light, but they are more than happy to help you out with anything.\n\nSuperdave's Superstore - Dave is nice, maybe even super.  If you are in need of knockoff sports memorabilia, this is your place to go.  A wide selection considering most of it doesn't pertain to the demographics of Markham.\n\nCuccina Moda - Overpriced, low quality kitchen appliances.  Nothing compared to Kitchen Stuff Plus\n\nThey also have a rolling tally of independent vendors setup in the main hallway.  Anything from coin collectors, to furniture repair, to children's books.

Since they were owned by the Marriott hotel that houses it, there wasn't much influence I could have over their wine list, and we already pretty much dominated it with some of our larger corporate profile wines. It's a shame really, because after dining there over the holidays I had a very good meal that would definitely warrant a second visit.\n\nAlthough the hotel was a bustle with energy after a recently ended football game (Meineke Car Care Bowl, or whatever the hell it's called now), the restaurant itself was virtually dead for dinner service on a Saturday night. This did give me a better chance to take in the surroundings, and notice the ornate chandelier (http://www.flickr.com/photos/wedoitforlove/4385725507/), along with a beautiful but non-functioning water display, and plates and silverware which seemed entirely too old-fashioned Southern elegant than necessary, including captain's chairs which didn't quite mesh with the tables. On the plus side, a virtually empty dining room caused service to be very attentive, and the food came out without delay.\n\nThe chef decided to start out with an amuse bouche of crab stuffed pastry (http://www.flickr.com/photos/wedoitforlove/4386490332/) with a homemade remoulade sauce. It was interesting, because I honestly wasn't even expecting an amuse here, but it was a nice surprise. The remoulade was a bit weak (I tend to like a little more spice), but the crab was nice in texture and flavor. It didn't take me long after those 2 bites to dive right into the sweet cornbread biscuits, thanks to the very soft butter. The biscuits were delicious, and were it not for a huge food order coming, I could have easily downed a dozen right then.\n\nThe first real course of the night was a lobster \"cobbler\", prepared as an \u00e9touff\u00e9e inside a phyllo tart (http://www.flickr.com/photos/wedoitforlove/4385726467/), with a side of saffron ice cream and topped with fresh chive. This was very close to my favorite dish of the night. The lobster flavor was fantastic, and although the saffron ice cream seemed strange at this point in the meal it really paired well with the strong flavors of the main component. The phyllo was perfectly flaky and taken as a whole bite just melts in your mouth. The next starter, braised beef short ribs served over gingerbread cookies (http://www.flickr.com/photos/wedoitforlove/4386491172/) was a little more disappointing, but still decent. The sweetness of the cookies was too much, and didn't mix well with the soy in the beef glaze, but at least the meat was extremely tender.\n\nThe soup course was next, and both options were frankly somewhat forgettable. The butternut squash soup (http://www.flickr.com/photos/wedoitforlove/4386491456/) was a bit bland, as it can often be, but usually chefs will do something the kick a little flavor in. Not so much here. But perhaps the biggest let down of the night was the pork belly stew (http://www.flickr.com/photos/wedoitforlove/4385727231/), which I had very high hopes for. It all became sort of a runny tomato mess, and the texture on the pork belly was very odd and somehow tough...almost like it had been in a freezer too long.\n\nAfter an intermezzo of chilled citrus sorbet, which acted as a wonderful palate cleanser, the main courses got them back on the road to redemption, both delivering solid flavors. The Scottish salmon (http://www.flickr.com/photos/wedoitforlove/4385727849/) was a very large portion, and cooked perfectly, flaking apart very nicely. The one downside was a general lack of seasoning in the dish, but at least the fish seemed pretty fresh so those flavors were enough to carry it as a whole. The duo of duck (http://www.flickr.com/photos/wedoitforlove/4385727613/), while looking a bit sloppy, was easily the best dish of the night, and something worth returning to Savannah Red to taste again. The breast portion was seared nicely, and very juicy, and the sauce on top really helped bring out the flavors of the meat as well as adding a hint of sweetness. The confit part was huge, as I would prefer it to be, and just fell apart under the fork, a really well cooked piece of meat.\n\nSince I've left Charlotte I'm a bit out of touch with the dining scene there, but it's nice to see good places like this still around, despite a very challenging location. Granted, most places would kill for the prime real estate downtown, but I have a feeling a lot of its presence is lost by the hotel towering above it, and a lobby that is completely distracting with all the other options.

That's before I even went into the pornographic details about how it was swimming in Makers Mark Caramel Bourbon Sauce that was set ablaze. So naughty.\n\nI mean, I don't even like donuts all that much but it just felt wrong not to order an item that was just so blatantly taunting. \n\nI kept my expectations at bay before dining here.

But what I found is that Savannah Red is actually a fabulous restaurant that stands on it's own two feet, with delicious food at tasty price points\n \nThings started off nicely with an amuse bouche of cauliflower soup, which was rich and delicious.\n\nI like to just nibble and taste so I ordered a few small dishes. The Jumbo Crab Cakes ($8) were pretty good, but keep in mind that the Cilantro Avocado Emulsion is little a small dollop on the plate. The Diver Scallop Ravioli w/ cream sauce, wilted greens, and Sriracha gastrique ($8) was my far my favorite dish ordered. You've got to try it. the greens are cooked perfectly and the two ravioli are large, fresh and meaty. \n\nI was given a bit of sorbet to cleanse the palate before being presented with my Pear and Endive salad, blue cheese brulee and pink apple vinaigrette. So good!\n\nInitially, I had no plans on ordering dessert. But the bread pudding was only $6 and sounded so novel that I had to give it a try. If you like donuts, you will love it.

My husband didn't complain, not one bit. That was part of the deal. I am pretty sure that he wasn't complaining, not because he wasn't allowed but because he really enjoyed the night! \nOne of the first things that came out to the table was these Delicious little corn bread rolls with kudzu flower butter. You know, kudzu, that shit vine you cannot kill even by setting your yard on fire? Yeah, that plant. Well apparently the flower is really sweet and some genius decided to flavor some butter with it. NCDOT, here is your sign. \n\nSo, rolls--check. Delish. \nThen, my drink came out. I guzzled my gin and tonic and became a wildly appropriately drunk. I mean, come on, it was my birthday--and the entire staff knew it. Dan ignored me during these first few intolerable moments, then he just gave up and enjoyed his dinner. \nI started off with this lobster puff pastry thing that was served with a side of saffron ice cream. Dan referred to it as the \"lobster ice cream thing.\" He eye humped my food until I gave him a taste. Then he just stole it. It was that good. \nDan had cold soup, which just that day, Michelle and I talked about how she wasn't a complete fan of cold soup, but to my surprise, Dan ate the whole bowl and wiped the bowl clean with the extra corn bread thing. We swapped plates because I wanted to have some too. I am sure the waiter was totally confused when he picked up the plates. He probably questioned himself the rest of the night wondering if he made a mistake in who was supposed to get what dish. I didn't tell or correct him. I let him wonder. I was drunk, please remember this was funny at the time. \nThen came my pork tenderloin with peach schnapps topping, collard greens and cornbread cakes. Wow. Not just good, fan-effing-tastic! \nDan had the fillet. Fresh garlic and mushrooms. I had some of his too. It was effing delish too! \nThen, we had the \"cleansing of the palate\" raspberry sorbet. What a treat. I love ice cream if you haven't figured that out. I ate mine in little increments to make it last. Dan ate the whole thing in one bite. \nThen came the best part. Krispy Kreme bread pudding with Maker's Mark glaze, and it came to the table on FIRE! No candles needed here! I think it was about 27 dough-nuts packed into a little bread pudding upside down dish. Probably about 10,000 calories. But all worth it. I nearly licked the plate..rememeber, I was intoxicated. (and the fire had gone out by that time.)\nDan had this chocolate banana puff pastry with rum ice cream. He didn't share with me. What a bastard. It looked good, and if it was any less than perfect he might have then shared it with me. So I guess his dessert was top notch. \nI would tell you how wonderful the bathrooms were or how pretty the soap was, or how clean the toilets were, however, I was wearing 6 inch heals that didn't really allow me to walk around that well, (again, insert intoxicated mentioning here...) \nI did however walk 7 blocks back to where we parked. Dan thought it would be nice to walk around after such a wonderful night. I would have let him carry me on his back, but my high cut dress would have shown off my goodies to everyone. And in my drunken state, I would have thought it was funny while Dan would be dying of shame in the corner. So I walked. \nSavannah Red was AWESOME!! Will most definitely return. I will use the valet service next time, and maybe get wildly INappropriate next time. Especially if I know that I don't have to walk far.", "business_id": "Nx8qL3HqmuTvzIq8C7xPDA", "stars": 5, "date": "2010-07-07", "useful": 10, "type": "review", "cool": 6}, {"funny": 4, "user_id": "MkFySOILZ4yhADa-0tZWZw", "review_id": "sZ5or0BWS2kwOPpfr98b2w", "text": "There's no shortage of cupcakeries in T.O. already, to the point that it's almost overkill but hear me out, DLish is pretty damned amazing and why you ask?  It's all about the imported French sprinkles.  Yes, as pretentious as that sounds these are no ordinary sprinkles...let me explain.  \n\nYou know when you get those really crappy generic cupcakes from the supermarket bakery, and they're covered in sprinkles be it rainbow or chocolate colored, they basically look like psychedelic mouse droppings and taste like stiff, mostly stale and indiscernibly sweet high fructose corn syrup pellets...in otherwords gawd awful and BORING!\n\nLeave it to the French to make something as simple as sprinkles pure genius, but what else can we expect but refinement from a place that invented the bidet?  Dlish's cupcakes are blessed with these phenomenal little French sprinkles that are made from Belgian Chocolate and every single solitary granule is wonderfully rich and in smooth flavour and texture. Having said this, obviously the best flavour bets imo are the cupcakes with either vanilla or chocolate sprinkles. Another nice thing is that the cupcake varieties at Dlish are more natural flavour based vs the day-glo colour frosted or gimmicky named and flavoured cupcakes served at other places. Dlish also boasts a handy Cupcake flavour schedule with a breakdown of what cupcake flavours are baked and sold on whichever days https://www.dlishcupcakes.com/menu\n\nThe first time I came here I was fortunate enough to be helped by the owner Verge who is impeccably polite and a wonderful ambassador for Dlish. Verge went on to carefully explain these cupcakes ideally shouldn't be refrigerated as they are FRESH baked everyday and handcrafted without preservatives or hydrogenated oils thus the refrigeration would just end up drying them out. Also kudos to their ergonomic box packaging/design which allows for a finger space to lift the cupcakes out of their allotted places in the box, which ensures you get a good grip on these bad boys, instead of a palmful of frosting.\n\nDon't let the super minimalist set-up fool or intimidate you into thinking these cupcakes are wimpy and don't let the price deter you either, because once you develop a taste for Dlish cupcakes you'll be possesed by the cupcake craving devil and soon you'll realise that Dlish cupcakes by design are like the Cartier of cupcakes.

You really do feel great (other than the searing pain and heat emanating from your loins). \n\nOne of the more experienced riders told me as she laughed at my misfortune that you get used to it and the skin down there gets tougher - right like I want calluses between mr. bo jangles and great beyond. \n\nI shall return for my second class - hopefully to less pain and suffering, however this time I am coming prepared and padding up my groin, with either a second pair of shorts OR an entire box of maxipads.....and I don't care who knows it. \n\nThanks Spynga for showing my the ropes and for helping me to realize that i need to get my ass in gear for beach season next year\n\n3/30", "business_id": "Wh-88_t2yJrJtXwCoXvuYg", "stars": 4, "date": "2012-10-03", "useful": 4, "type": "review", "cool": 4}, {"funny": 3, "user_id": "XChCfeJ6Yx2NDJIpIgRhyg", "review_id": "Q2dDA79AJKM5bUSuCDvfzg", "text": "You'll be sweating like buckets!! \n\nA couple of days ago I was talking to Jennifer K \" the walking yelp search app\"  and she mentioned to me that's she's been spinning at a studio in Thornhill. Ok that's nearby where I am tell me more. Needless to say a couple of days later I found myself signing up for 2 class trial offer for $20. \n\nIt didn't take much convincing as I'm all gung ho on fitness. I go to a gym nearby and we have upright bikes there,  but I was more curious than any to try spinning in a 'class environment'.\n\nThe studio is located on the upper most level of the plaza on Disera Dr  which is just opposite the Promenade Mall. There's plenty free parking available at the back.\n\nI took the flight of stairs up to the second level. No Spynga signs posted but I found it a few paces down the hallway. \n\nLayout:\n\nThe layout  is very loft like, high ceilings, with an all white interior. There's a front reception area for the admin, around the corner there's two smaller rooms for private instruction, a few change rooms, and one seriously GINORMOUS studio space that houses the 30 Schwinn spin bikes. They use half of the area for bikes and the other half to run the yoga classes. It's a really big naturally lit facility. \n\nThey also sell their own branded Spynga apparel, bike shoes, organic products, drinks and have complimentary spring water. \n\nExperience:\n\nSo there were three Yelpers (Jennifer, Wayne, myself) for the 10:10am class, plus 4 other people. Kind of empty, but good. \n\nPrior to class start, we entered the studio a bit earlier to adjust the bikes (raised/lowered the seat, handle bar, height, inc/dec tension) and started our warm up. \n\nThe music was mostly top 40 dance, which I had no objections about. It was appropriate to get your heart racing!  The instructor took us through a warmup and scenarios where we pretended to be climbing up a hill, or going flat out on the road. You learn 3 hand positions in the beginning which you will use throughout the session. \n\nThe instructor was lively and motivating -- keeping the counts. At times she got off the bike at the front of the class to come around and motivate and push us further.. \n\nWe finished the 50min of cycling with a stretch then hit the mats for about 10 minutes for some grueling core exercises. I think I will have to take a day or two to recover from all this. :)\n\nThoughts:\n\nPace yourself according to your fitness level and class time allotted. \nHave plenty of fluids available. Recommend 2 bottles of water. \nThere are gel seat covers at the front if you need them. I'd use them! :p\n\nSo how did I like this?  It's paid torture but as soon as I regain the feeling back in my a$$ and arms (you do a lot of pushups on the bike surprisingly) I'd be back on the saddle.", "business_id": "Wh-88_t2yJrJtXwCoXvuYg", "stars": 4, "date": "2012-04-26", "useful": 3, "type": "review", "cool": 1}, {"funny": 7, "user_id": "PSI7wvuqEhhV9Jh_fP2eZQ", "review_id": "aEAzYgXHq1K8hDCHFgHUiQ", "text": "I see a\u00e7a\u00ed businesses popping up all over Las Vegas, but the original Juice 'n' Go drive-thru was the first acai bowl I tried.

Massage.  Ever.\n\nI guess I should clarify that a little.  \"Worst massage experience ever\" is a little more appropriate.  I came to this establishment because I bought a Groupon for a 60-minute massage and optional spray tan.  I was a first time client, which is what these marketing promotions are supposed to attract, right?  Well, rest assured I will never step foot on the premises again.  If you don't want to read the whole review, the take-away keywords are: unprofessional, trashy and appalling.  \n\nThis miserable tale begins with me arriving a few minutes early to the strip mall where this place is located.  The office area appears to have a number of people operating various businesses out of one space with one common waiting room.  Fifteen minutes after the massage was supposed to start, Jan Thompson (owner) came out, apologized for running late and said she would be ready in a moment.  \n\nAfter a few minutes, I entered the massage room that doubles as a spray tan application area.  The room was rather trashy, with products and random things shoved in corners and around the perimeter of the room.  The room was right next to the front door so it wasn't very quiet.  Also, the front of the room consisted of store front windows that were somewhat poorly covered both in style and effect.  The room did nothing to lend itself to a relaxing environment.  Had I been paying full price for this massage I would have probably just turned around then but since it was only $39 I figured I'd just go with it.  \"How bad could it be?\" I foolishly asked myself.  Jan introduced herself, told me that she would be using hot stones during the massage if that was okay and then asked if I had any requests.  I said that I had been to the chiropractor the day before and would like her focus on my lower back and leg muscles.   She said she would be happy to do that and said she would be checking in with me throughout the massage to make sure the pressure was okay.  I said that would be great because I tend to prefer more of a deep tissue massage to which she responded \"I have strong hands so I'll make sure to check to make sure it's not too much.\" \n\nThe massage began with Jan attempting to strike up some conversation.  Personally, I don't care to talk during a massage with someone I'm not familiar with but, whatever.  She asked which chiropractor I was seeing.  A seemingly innocuous question, right?  I told her my chiropractor's name to which she responded, \"Oh, I don't like her.  She soaked my mom dry.  She had her on all this stuff, some sort of powder, and none of it helped her...\"  Now, I'm all for sharing personal experiences and reviews (obviously) but I didn't care to hear Jan trash talk my chiropractor and personal friend DURING MY MASSAGE.  I find it incredibly unprofessional for someone to make such comments to a total stranger, especially in this setting.  I responded with a vague, placating comment and tried to just shrug it off in hopes of salvaging this massage.  Unfortunately, there was no salvaging to be had.\n\nThe massage continued adequately with the use of hot stones and some stretching.  Suddenly, I hear some beeps behind me and a whirring sound.  Jan said she was warming up a neck pillow for me to help relax my muscles.  I think this was the first time I've experienced a microwave being used during a massage-but this massage was pretty atypical from the start so I just rolled with it.  And then I began to hear a vibrating noise.  At first I thought I accidentally turned my phone on vibrate instead of silent until I realized it was coming from a table closer to my head.  It was Jan's phone, and it kept vibrating.  There were probably five phone calls worth before she stopped the massage, told me she had a flat tire and needed to check her messages to make sure the towing company wasn't outside.  In shock, I said \"okay\".  She proceeded to listen to all of her messages, apologized and then continued the massage.  After several minutes, the vibrating began again and after a few more calls she again stopped the massage.  She again apologized and said the towing company was outside and she needed to step away for a few minutes.  I just laid there, in awe of how ridiculous this experience had been so far, and just said \"okay\".\n\nAfter about five minutes Jan came back, apologized again and said that I could come back sometime and she would give me a free 30 minute massage to make up for the interruptions.  The massage had lasted 45 minutes at this point and I was still lying on my back.  My one request was to have my lower back and leg muscles focused on and we hadn't even gotten to that yet.

We were pretty dissapointed because we each HAD an order, and basically were forced to order two bowls of pho. So we got two small bowls of pho, one for $7, the other for $6.50.

This weekends venue is beautiful sitting at Lake Las Vegas which is on Lake Mead but east of Boulder Highway.  I was here from beginning to end not as a participant but as a volunteer.\n\nMy parents live on the way at Flamingo and Boulder, east by the mountains, and so I figure I can visit them then work a little bit before going off and hanging out friends afterwards.  Ended up at YelpHQ instead but that was even more fun.  As a volunteer, time working the booth really flew by.  Then again, time flies by when you're having fun.  I thought our team leader was gonna be late so I wanted to run the show but she was there.  There were tons of volunteers as well, Yelp was given two booths out of the twenty to man and one of those booths had a photo booth for memories.  I hope you readers that attended took advantage of that!\n\nThe start of the event was at 7pm, each wine glass was to be filled with 1 oz of wine.  Our booth (#3) had a.. wait for it.. let me get a hell yea for the Thorny Rose a Pinot Grigio, a refreshing white wine with melon, lemon, and other perfect fruity combinations.  We were given a sheet to display what this wine was but as a group we memorized it in case people asked.  I told some people it was a Horny Rose, but they must have been toasted since they didn't catch on.  It was so good that we weren't even allowed to taste it but people wanted us to stamp another booth's number so they can have seconds.  Nope, sorry!  I do believe other tables were pouring over 1 oz of wine though.\n\nPortion control is important because by 9PM the wine was running low and we were completely out soon after.  Some of the wine tables were hidden from the main pathway also so I kept having people come up to me asking where whatever table number was where.  Maybe the tables could be placed in numerical order so they can backtrack if they caught themselves skipping one by accident?\n\nBut hey vino fans, next time do come early so you can sample the wines and after you're done and have gotten your good fix you can sit around on the grass and enjoy the entertainment provided or eat at a restaurant.  It was sad to see the pizza place closed though!  Wine goes perfect with pizza, didn't you know that?  In the end just know that you participated in a fundraiser for a good cause and hope you checked in and received your free wine glass charm.  \n\nShout outs to my fellow volunteers Pam, Ron, Robin and her dude, Vanessa, Tony, Nathan, Christina, Arvin, Anthony, Shirley, and Teri who had to leave early cause of a stomach bug.  If I missed anyone else I apologize!  And to everyone who stopped by the Yelp booth to say hi and chit chat about Yelp, you guys are awesome.  \n\nAnd the \"unofficial\" line that was formed with people checking in or downloading the app, signing up, then checking in, we didn't mean for it to happen but thank you to those people as well.

My friend and chatted briefly before the class began and we were scolded as soon as Teena, the yoga instructor, graced us with her enduring presence.\n\nWe were whispering - and as Teena walked in (at 12:06 pm, by the way) she told us not to speak during the class. We understood it was disrespectful, and we apologized. We then received a 2-3 sentence-long micro-lecture about respecting the class. This was unnecessary and further disrupted the already late class, if anything.\n\nTeena is a yoga instructor who seems to have all the sweetness and charm of a military tribunal judge. She is fond of announcing participant errors to the entire class (i.e. curling toes during child's pose is strictly forbidden) and she seemed to relish every opportunity to critique anything that didn't meet her standards.\n\nTowards the end of the class, she provided a scripted speech about respecting the space and relaxing during shavasan...and once again we got a little sermon about keeping quiet in the class (OK - message conveyed, loud and clear). \n\nI guess my friend and I failed to demonstrate enough shame and/or discomfort, because AFTER CLASS Teena pulled us aside to scold us in the manner of a much-maligned yogi despot. She wanted to be sure we were aware of just how wrong we were for trying to perform other poses or modifications when her instructions proved to set the bar too high for us mere mortals. \n\nThe studio owner happened to be listening to our conversation at that point; she heard most of what seemed to be escalating into an argument. At that point I left the room to change. I returned in a few minutes with my friend so that we could speak with the business owner in more detail. \n\nI waited some time between my experience and posting this review. My discussion with the business owner after class led me to believe that she would follow up with Teena about her unprofessional behaviour. Sadly, even sending a thoughtful email to follow up specific concerns yielded only a short, dismissive reply. \n\nI hope the other yoga instructors here are better at teaching yoga.

Divide that by $9.50. That's 21 hours...now figure on how many hours you will invest driving back and forth to Factory Direct every time the phone stops working ( on average 4-5 trips per year). Then figure in the cost of parking, if any. Do add in the cost of gas getting there and back.  Then, and this is important, calculate how much time you will have to wait in the store for the chance to speak to the useless manager after having to speak to the wildly uninformed tech staff who do not really know much about technology, but will nonetheless pretend they know and speculate what the problem MIGHT be.\n \nThen add in 45 minutes while they \"fill out the necessary paperwork and try to get head office on the phone to verify\" whatever they have to verify to allow you to send your phone in under warranty. Then, IF you actually qualify to get your phone fixed (and remember, it's a refurbished phone to start with...), then calculate the 4-8 weeks you will be without a phone and the twice-a-week calls you will have to make to see if your phone is returned YET. if they replace your phone, which is what they do, but it takes them 4-8 weeks to make that decision because there is no profit at there in to fix an already refurbished phone, make sure the new phone is truly unlocked for the carrier you use. Sometime they claim it is, but it isn't and then you have to argue further to get a phone that is what they advertise it is.\n\nTrust me.

In the summer, the city shows outdoor movies here twice a week--once on Wed. with a concert from a local band beforehand, and once on Sun.  Despite having known about this for almost as long as I've lived in PGH, it took me this long to finally experience it--I actually was planning to go the weekend before last, but was rained out.\n\nThe movies start at \"dusk,\" which ended up being around 9pm last Sun.  The city publishes a schedule that states what movies they're playing on what days, so you can plan accordingly based on your tastes.  The movie I saw was Big Hero 6, which was a great movie, and was family-friendly, so there were a number of children in the audience.  Although others had told me that the sound quality wasn't the best, I had no trouble hearing the sound track from where I was seated--but then again, I was in the middle and fairly close to the front of the crowd.  I'd recommend arriving at least a half an hour in advance to secure a decent spot, and bringing either a picnic blanket or lawn chairs to sit in, as well as bug spray to ward off the mosquitos.\n\nThe great thing about outdoor movies is that there's leeway to do things not otherwise acceptable at movie theaters, such as quiet talking/whispering, running around (some kids were playing flashlight tag off to the side when I was there), and bringing snacks (I do this anyway, but it's great to not have to sneak them in!).  The park and the neighborhood of Oakland make a great backdrop for an outdoor movie, and the hill is large and gently sloping, so Flagstaff Hill is probably the best place in PGH to see one.

Flagstaff Hill is the first big hill that you see as you walk from Oakland, past the library, and over the bridge towards Phipps and the park. It's a very familiar place for me, since the best part about this spot is that you get the sense of being in the middle of a park without actually having to walk to the middle of one. It's a great location for anyone looking to take a quick walk and get a short break from the bustling Oakland - which I admittedly needed a lot when I lived in the area.\n\nIn addition to being a great place to be with yourself, it's a fun place to hang out with other people. Back when I was a student, my classmates and I would take time to just sit in the grass or would play Frisbee on nice days during the school year here. We weren't alone in this, either. College or local sports teams will regularly practice various sports here, including flag football. Flagstaff is also a favorite spot for studying, reading, sunbathing, and other similar activities. \n\nSide note: if you find that you avoid the hill a lot during the year because of said students and sports teams, try a summer visit. During the summer the hill kind of switches from a student haven to a public area, especially during free movie nights in the park. I admittedly have a difficult time making it out to these events now due to how late they tend to run, but it is very nice that we have this option in our city, and a lot of the movies make for great family outings or friendly get-togethers.\n\nNo matter what time of year it is, the hill's usually occupied to some degree, whether by sunbathing students, locals playing a game, or just people casually sitting at the top enjoying the view. It's definitely a useful and multipurpose hill. (Never thought I'd get the chance to write that!) I have plenty to say about the rest of the park, but that's for another review.

I asked him if he had this game used and he doesn't even bother to go behind the counter to check. He just says \"probably not but even if we did, it would be the same price because this is reduced price.\" Which I know is not true and even if it was, I would be able to use my \"Power Up Reward\" card to save 10% and would be cheaper than the new version and if I didn't have that card it would be an opportunity for him to sell one to me! I worked at Gamestop before and I know that used games are what keep that place in business and he should hop on the opportunity to sell someone a used product, especially someone that's asking for a used product, but he doesn't even bother to check. It's not that the store was busy. It was slow enough for him to get from behind the counter and walk up to the people in the store and ask if he can help them with anything. There was only me and one other person in the store and apparently he couldn't help me with anything. \n\n I've come to accept the fact that I'm probably not going to get good customer service but I probably know more about anything I'm going in there for than anyone working there so I typically don't need their help... Unless it's to check if you have something in stock that I may have missed because there may not be a display case on the shelves or what have you. Stuff that only the employees can handle. Stuff that this guy didn't handle. \n\n   That bugged me that he couldn't do a simple task like that but as I said, I expected that and still looked around for another 15 minutes or so until I was ready to check out. At this point, not really pissed of or anything, it was a typical GS experience to me and was pretty much what I was expecting. \n\nUntil I got in line.\n\n   There were two other customers in line and the person in the front of the line was ready to pay and check out. Found the game he wanted. He was buying Black Ops for the 360. He was with his friend who was the guy that handed the game to employee. Nothing wrong there. Business as usual. The employee asks to see an ID because it's an \"M\" rated game. Standard, the guy that's actually paying for the game produces an ID. Nothing out of the ordinary there but then the guy ask to see the ID of the guy that handed him the game case! The guy couldn't produce an ID, it's most likely because he's probably an illegal immigrant than him being a minor because both of the guys looked my age (28) if not older. They were literally two guys that were about 5' 8\", probably around 170lbs each, the guy paying (that had the ID) had facial hair that a minor wouldn't be able to produce and the other guy had a face of someone that was in his mid to late 20's. \n\n   The employees says \"I need to see both of you IDs because he's the one that handed that game to me and I can't sell an M rated game to minors.\" \"I'm on camera and because this game is M rated I can't sell it to you unless you show me an ID.\" \n\n   WHAT THE F IS THAT SHIT! Because he handed it to me, he has to produce an ID even though the person actually paying for the game has an ID and is producing the ID and both guys were obviously over 18 years old. But because the guy that handed the game to him doesn't have an ID, he can't sell the game to the other guy that's actually paying for it!!! What kind of bull shit is that! This went on for like 5 minutes. This is complete bull shit. You're telling me that if a kid handed Black Ops to the guy at the register, even if that kid's mom was standing right there, and the employee goes through the whole spiel of saying this game is rated M for mature for blood, gore and violence, and the mom says it's cool, they basically won't sell the game to them because the kid is going to have to produce an ID and since he can't, his mom can't buy it either because the kid handed it to him and she would be buying it for a minor.... What a complete load of shit. \n\n   I thought it was a complete load of shit and it was wasting my time so I put the two games I had down and said \"this is a load of shit, screw this\" and as I was walking out the employee says \"No Ids?\" to me then I said \" No I got my ID. These guys are obviously two adults and you pulling this bull shit and wasting our time.\" and I just left. \n\n   There was the guys in the front of the line and me that were ready to give them our money (I'm not sure about the family in front of me. They might have just had a question but they were getting fed up with the situation as well.) but apparently the people at Gamestop don't want our money.

I was told that reservations were necessary so I made one for 5. \nWe arrived and the place was pretty close to EMPTY for playoffs.  There was no clear host station so we just walked around until we saw people in 40/40 shirts. We asked where do we check in. We were directed to a woman who was just standing around, dressed as we were; no name tag or 40/40 insignia.  I told her we had reservations. She DID NOT ask our name; just how many were in our party. We were then walked in a FULL circle around the place to find somewhere to sit.  We stopped at NUMEROUS areas before finally being seated in a very nice area with sueded (or microfiber) walls, pillows and bench, 3 white leather chairs, two ottomans and a coffee table. The decor was very impressive, however, THIS is where the fun ended.  \n\nThe menu was encyclopedia-heavy, with 2-3 pages for food and 7,639 CHAPTERS (it seemed) of PRICEY drinks with trying-WAAAYYY-too-hard names.\nDON'T come hungry, poor OR expecting greatness. You'll get a half-assed attempt at UNSEASONED, hardly microwaved frozen food and a sorry pile of bullshit disguised as salad or a garnish on your plate.\n\nWe started off trying out several appetizers. (Crab Cakes, Breaded Catfish Sticks, Buffalo Wings, The Picnic {should have been named the YUCKFUCK!}, and Cheese Bread.)  EVERYTHING arrived LUKE-FRIGID except for the dry hot wings which were a work-with-able temperature.  The \"cheese bread\" was nothing more than Grocery Outlet-quality  frozen deep dish pizza cut into 4 uneven sticks. It arrived to us looking like it had seen a ghost; PETRIFIED. It was cold, hard, and dry...and $8!! **tears**  As a fat girl, I'll try anything ONCE, but just the sight of those 4 dead bodies saved me from a few unnecessary calories.  \nI cut the roof of my mouth on the hard chicken \"shits\" that were part of The Picnic. The breading was so hard that it couldn't be bitten into. I had to tear them apart with my hands and melt them in Ranch for a good minute or 5 JUST to be able to TASTE them. And I was more than disappointed once I started chewing. The Picnic consisted of 2 fried deviled eggs (BLECH!) and too many hard, dry chicken shits all for $12.  I wish I would have asked for my $11.99 in change.\n\nOur waitress was very unknowledgeable about the menu. She seemed young and unprepared for the job.  When asking about certain dishes she'd only  \"heard\" everything was good but didn't KNOW ANYthing. Food was brought out WITHOUT the promised dipping sauces and when requested, the waitress acted as if she'd NEVER heard of them, even though we pointed them out on the menu! She said, \"Well this is how they always come out.\"  We were offered Ranch and a buffalo dipping sauce and that's IT. Great! [/sarcasm] \nWhen requesting water, we were brought a carafe of water with lemon. I asked if we could have one without lemon and was told that it would take about 20 minutes.  Water with lemon...INSTANTLY!! Water WITHOUT lemon...20 minutes. Ok...that makes sense. [/sarcasm]  So Annoyed, I just cancelled the water and decided to live with the metallic taste of blood from the skin on the roof of my mouth hanging to my tongue after attempting to eat the dry chicken shits.  \n\nBesides the food and service, what annoyed us most was the plastic shopping bag of 40/40 paraphernalia the waitress carried. I thought she had just walked into work and didn't have time to drop her things off before manning her stations. I asked what was she carrying and was told that they're MADE to carry souvenirs just in case patrons want to purchase them. My thoughts: \"Ummm...whatever happened to a STORE?!\" I felt sorry for the girl as she juggled menus, plates, glasses, and tabs while trying to keep the crumpled bag on her shoulder.\n\nOverall, I just PRAY this is JUST a franchise and Jigga-Man is NOT directly in charge of this fuckery.

She carried it the WHOLE night, and so did another girl working there. Do not understand!) and brought us to what I thought was a temporary seating area before we were brought to our table. She came by with a thick menu and told us that this actually was our seating area - it was like a lounge couch and a coffee table.

Cool. Don't know how it happened but I'll take the fame and glory! thx\n\nI kind of have mixed feelings about this place. I just went this past Saturday and I will say that I had more fun here than I had at Poetry on Friday. I've been hearing nothing but bad things about this place but I had to check it out because it's Jay's spot and I've never been to the one in NY. Now the place is HUGE but maybe because I didn't go in until 2AM (no line) there just wasn't that many people inside. What I can say though is, it's wayyyyy too overpriced for what you get. Yeah the music was great, the decor is off the chain, but I paid 30 to get in. Then paid another 30 for 2 f*ckin drinks!!!! I'm sorry even for vegas that's doing too much. No wonder chicks were houndin me for drinks all night (broke a$$es). Anyway, other than that everyone there was real cool, security is cool and friendly, the chicks weren't all completely stuckup compared to the hoodrats at Poetry. My drunk ass just had fun and I had a great time. Now would I go back? Ummm maybe if I got in for free or maybe if there was a special event, but honestly it's just a sports lounge that doesn't offer anything special besides having the bragging rights of saying you went to 40/40. \n\nSo here's some inside info that I got from security, so if you plan on dressing or looking hood, you can't say you were not warned. Security is so strict (Palazzo ain't playin') that they filter out who they don't want in the club from the ENTRANCE OF THE CASINO! So let's say you pull in you ride smellin like weed bumpin some Wayne lookin like a bloods and crips reunion album cover, the security from the entrance radios the valet parking, when you pull up to valet parking, they will tell you it's full, so they hope that instead of trying to find self parking and walking to the club you'll just end up going somewhere else. Now let's say that you do self park and walk all the way over to the club, well the security in the casino already knows who to look for they radio the club door and they will tell you they aren't letting people in, it's packed etc. So my suggestion is dress to impress or you're gonna get th run around, it's VEGAS dammit! If you wanna keep it hood stay on the north side or kick it on the strip in front of PH with all the rest of the hood.", "business_id": "DzNk7Chv42gNobL3Wqqt_w", "stars": 3, "date": "2008-05-14", "useful": 10, "type": "review", "cool": 5}, {"funny": 13, "user_id": "wL-eQ6ZPYj-kUOh2uPavTw", "review_id": "1U8o9Ysbyk9I7Ed0C9HSDQ", "text": "Jay-Z and Damon Dash I must say I expected more out you both. I have been of fan since I can remember but 40/40 makes me realize that there can be hiccups in successful careers. I love sports bars like no other but this one came up short. On my first trip to the 40/40 and what may be my last, I was reminded of several Jay-Z classics...\n\nFirst, \"99 Problems\"...and yes...your bitch is one of them! Can we say the women here are rude as hell and I am talking about the bar-wenches. When I am trying get my drink on, I don't need my bartender to take forever to take my order, be rude and on top of that poor a sorry ass drink.   \n\n\"Can I Get A\" What? What?....A drink dammit! After the disappointment of the first, I needed another quickly. I swear my group and I made up about 50 percent of the patrons that evening and you would think service would be prompt but it wasn't. Arghh!! So since the NBA finals were on, my group and I decided to get some bottle service and a private room. \"Show Me What You Got\" to the host I said and we were directed to the Alex Rodriguez private room. I must digress that I am one of those Yankee haters and think everything the team does is foul but 40/40 with A-Rod's help hit a home run with this one....\"BIG PIMPIN\". Decor was beautiful with couches, flat-screen and a pool table. We ordered food which was something to be desired but the awesome space made up for it.  By the way, food came out incorrectly 2 times.\n\nSpeaking of \"Big Pimpin\", 40/40 did indeed \"Change the Game\" when it comes to taking advantage of the avid sports fan. I was impressed with the vast numbers of TVs and the huge theater size screen in the middle of the club that plays ESPN constantly. The stadium seating of couches was very impressive as well.  \n\nOverall my experience here left a bad taste in my mouth. Do I want an \"Encore\"? Well, there is nothing but \"Girls, Girls, Girls\" looking like they just came out of a video and need to \"Change Clothes\" and the \"Roc Boys\" who aren't \"winners\" try way to hard to floss their fake chains. If you are looking for that kind of environment,  then this is the place for you. Because I am a sports fanatic I will give it another go for another major sporting event but until then 40/40 has definitely \"Lost One\".", "business_id": "DzNk7Chv42gNobL3Wqqt_w", "stars": 2, "date": "2008-06-24", "useful": 8, "type": "review", "cool": 8}, {"funny": 4, "user_id": "A2HbQtcuK2tkegX7BXcEtg", "review_id": "sT9yxn0kcPKHOpADiFwILQ", "text": "Figlio di puttana, sai che tu sei un pezzo di merda?

I have enjoyed my experience at The Wiener's Circle inside Red Rock, but there is something about this location inside Santa Fe that was just better to me. If you are familiar with the original The Wiener's Circle in Chicago, then you know they have a different attitude when it gets dark. Here at this location they don't sling any insults (they play games with customers and sling expected insults at the original location after a certain hour even handing out free food and shirts sometimes) or play any games, but what I have experienced is great customer service. The guy who took my order was very nice and patient while I went over the menu. He also told me about different combo deals that include fried and a drink. I have to give them props as far as the menu prices go. Being in a casino usually means marked up prices and sometimes not the same product you'd expect, but I found the prices to be fair and the food tasted great. I've been back a few times now and will be back plenty more! \n\nChar Dog - I got the combo priced at $6.99 that came with fries and a drink. The dog had onions, relish, mustard, pickles, tomatoes, peppers and celery salt. I asked that the dog be lightly charred and that's exactly what I got. The cook even came over to our table to make sure I liked it. I had them add cheese to my fries and the cheese sauce is thick and delicious! I could eat a huge pile (they already give you 1/2 pound with your order) of just those fries covered in cheese and my taste buds would be happy. \n\nChicken Fingers - As a combo it was $7.99 with fries and a drink. They also give you a choice of mustard, ranch and honey mustard to dip your fingers. I really like the honey mustard here it goes well with the fingers. The fingers didn't look to plump or appetizing when I first saw them, but they really had good flavor and the chicken tasted good enough with out any sauce to dip, but trust me and pair it with the honey mustard. \n\nWieners in a Blanket  - These were $4.99 and tasty little bites!

Il \u00e9tait 21h. Je n'avais pas encore mang\u00e9, et l'envie de prendre des sushis fut imm\u00e9diate.\n\nI Love Sushi (Rue Saint-Denis, non loin de l'intersection Rue Rachel Est) est, comme son nom l'indique, un restaurant \u00e0 sushis.\n\nL'int\u00e9rieur n'a vraiment rien d'exceptionnel, mais ce n'est pas le d\u00e9cor qui me d\u00e9range personnellement. D'ailleurs, il y a une petite terrasse ext\u00e9rieure qui n'est pas pour me d\u00e9plaire : bien pour y manger durant l'\u00e9t\u00e9. Mais parlons plus des sushis.\n\nVous avez plusieurs choix qui s'offrent \u00e0 vous : des makis/sashimis/sushis aux compositions originales, \u00e0 la carte (par 5 ou 6 il me semble), ou bien les menus du chef (\"menus express\") avec diverses compositions. \u00c0 noter que ces derniers sont moins chers le midi que le soir.\n\u00c0 ce propos, question prix, c'est vraiment tr\u00e8s abordable : comptez 8$ pour le menu le moins cher (sans la boisson et le dessert). Je crois que le plus cher co\u00fbte dans les 24$, mais vous avez plus de sushis :)\n\nLe temps de pr\u00e9paration n'est pas si long que \u00e7a : \u00e0 chaque commande, j'avais attendu 5 \u00e0 6 minutes, ce qui est vraiment rapide. On vous fournit wasabi, sauce soja et gingembre bien entendu.\n\nPour ce qui est de la qualit\u00e9, c'est correct, voire tr\u00e8s correct. Chaque bouch\u00e9e est un d\u00e9lice, le temps de bien savourer votre plat : le succ\u00e8s est toujours au rendez-vous.\n\u00c0 la fin, vous avez le ventre bien rempli !\n\nLe restaurant est tenu par un couple vietnamien super sympa, ils me rappellent m\u00eame mes parents.

Pas le meilleur restaurant sushis, mais pour un \u00e9tudiant comme moi, c'est le fun.\n\nPetit plus : vous pouvez t\u00e9l\u00e9phoner \u00e0 l'avance pour commander, le temps qu'ils pr\u00e9parent votre menu.

I was blissed out, woozy and teetering like a daytime lush when I walked out after my 90 minutes of magic. \n\nLeslie Ferranti was my esthetician at Camden Spa and when I heard that she was opening her own shop I audibly squealed with both terror and glee. Terror because I could already hear my debit card groaning in anticipation of future overuse (how could I NOT get a facial, waxing and other treatments every month??) and glee because, well, read on...\n\nYou won't find Darling Spa noisily beckoning you inside its doors with sandwich board specials or assaulting you with flyers while you shop on Queen Street West. No, you'll find out about Darling Spa from your friends (the ones that truly love you and don't mind sharing their secret to great skin!) and fellow yelpers, because it's quietly tucked away in a building on Maud Street just south of Queen & Augusta. Once inside, you'll start making mental notes of every inch of space for future home decor projects. Leslie's got great taste in furniture and accoutrements - beautiful light grey walls accented by white furniture and black bits of art and other accessories. \n\nThe guest washroom is perhaps better appointed than even my own, with a host of products and thoughtful touches that make you feel right at home - dental floss, feminine products, tissues, makeup remover, wet wipes, the lot. The treatment room and main space are equally beautiful and relaxing. I almost fell asleep during a leg wax, for crying out loud. \n\nSo, about the waxing. As expected, it's quick, professional and affordable. I have a high tolerance for pain but it wasn't called upon here as Leslie is a fast worker and kept my mind busy with interesting conversation and really great music as a soundtrack. Who wouldn't love getting their legs waxed to the tune of \"I Love NYE\" by Badly Drawn Boy and \"Sexy Boy\" by Air? I left hairless and with nary a skin irritation in sight. I'll be back in four weeks.\n\nThe star of the show here is the signature facial. As previously mentioned, it's the facial to end all facials and I think I drunkenly declared those very words to those in the waiting room (can't remember, I was in a state of confusion when I emerged from the treatment room. Imagine waking from a century long cryogenic slumber and you'll know what I was dealing with here). If you love yourself (and you should!) you'll come here regularly for this absolute treat. Leslie herself has incredible skin (try not to stare), which is a lovely testament to her expertise and support of the dermal advice she dispenses. Nothing worse than getting worked on by someone who doesn't practice what they preach, right? \n\nIt feels weird describing a 90 minute orgasm, but I'll try. \n\nLeslie knew exactly what she was getting into with my skin from my days as a client at the other spa, so she went straight to work. I openly accepted a series of hot towels, fine mists, foaming treatments, fruit enzyme scrubs, masks and cold creams (all by Dermalogica) on my cranky and grateful skin. I don't think I even winced during extraction, and there was lots of it to be done. Then came a series of massages, which is about when I had to seriously stop myself from audibly voicing my extreme pleasure. Apparently Leslie also fancies herself a Registered Massage Therapist?! WHO KNEW? Honestly the best massage I've ever had**. I sleep on my stomach and have notoriously tight neck and shoulder muscles. The three-pronged attack of arm/hand, neck/shoulders and then scalp massage nearly turned me into a puddle.

Yes, I'll be there.\"\n\nSo i finished up whatever work i could, emailed my boss about the tasks i'd completed that day, put the dog in the car, called my friend in Phoenix, and drove out there.

They asked me if I had been watching on the webcam. I hadn't been, I forgot that they had mentioned webcam in the midst of everything I had to do that day, but I've actually watched it a few times since then. I am the creep in Los Angeles who is watching your dog.\n\nI asked them what would have happened if I had forgotten and left the dog there, not realizing until halfway to Los Angeles.

Ah, the first answer is always a joke. Way to buy yourself some time. They said that they would have taken care of it overnight, tried to track me down, kept watch of it for a few days, seen if they could find any other information. Then they would have tried to find it a new owner. Good answer, i decided. I paid them, thanked them, and took the dog out to my car. \"I'm choosing the music for the trip back,\" I informed it. \"I can't stand another repeat of the Baha Men CD.\"", "business_id": "AHJH-m56qft40YBmYaBXSg", "stars": 5, "date": "2010-04-28", "useful": 2, "type": "review", "cool": 2}, {"funny": 5, "user_id": "NjLRgbRZiwEIMpAgXypJtw", "review_id": "wHhS-uRnfLm6ta8kFsw1aQ", "text": "Gay men, skip along to the next one.\n\nEveryone else should be at least moderately concerned about female breast health....\n\nI was a little concerned about my first baseline mammogram today, but let me tell you, ladies, it was nothing.

Apparently a pimp........oops I meant an escort manager and his escorts decided to show up and bowl? I left it as a question because either they were really bored and had no action or were just in the neighborhood. According to eyewitness accounts, the escort manager sees Soul and thought he looked like him so he started giving him 20 dollar bills intermittently while showing off his bling along with his escorts.\n\nSo overall, everybody had fun.

Great to finally meet Colleen & Kayla and I loved how folks just dropped in all during the night to hang for a bit or a while. \n\nI only bowled a few frames for Roger or Tom because I suck at bowling and hate when I can't do things.

Clearly Shawn is not raising a fool: Soul pocketed the $$$ threw some high fives to Big Daddy (\"don't he look like me?!\") and had a great time. \n\nLoved hanging out with Rod, Angie, Chris, Kevin, Jade, Scott, Roger & his beautiful wife and meeting a few folks as they left. \n\nIt was an \"only in Vegas\" moment for sure.
