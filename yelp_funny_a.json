I was very much looking forward to going to Modern on Melrose as my sister had raved about the selection and several purchases she recently made here. I was all set to help her select more furniture for her new home until I experienced a combination of disbelief, shock and horror. \n\nI was inside the store when I heard a man loudly say \"If you're going to start a sale, finish it!\" It took a few more seconds of loud voices before I realized an argument was taking place between two employees and not two customers, as I initially thought. The male and female employee continued to loudly argue, back and forth. Feeling very uncomfortable, I started to look for my sister. There were about four other customers and we all ended up outside as we all felt very uncomfortable in the store. \n\nAs I was walking out of the store to go out back, I heard the male employee say, in a tone that was beyond anger but instead violent, \"Don't you ever tell me to shut up! Ever!\" Shortly after, he walked past all 5 female customers, who had gathered out back, turned to us and angrily said \"Bitch!\" Not knowing what he was going to do when he returned, we decided to leave as we did not feel safe. \n\nIt is one thing to feel uncomfortable, it is completely unacceptable to not feel safe. The interaction between the two employees was the most unprofessional thing I have ever witnessed. The male and female employee were so caught up in their own negative interaction, neither of them offered any customer service. And after their argument ended, the female employee offered no apologies and still no customer service. \n\nToday was my first and last time in Modern on Melrose. How terribly sad for this store. I sincerely hope the owners get a handle on this and educate their employees as to what it and isn't acceptable behavior.", "business_id": "2LfIuF3_sX6uwe-IR-P0jQ", "stars": 1, "date": "2013-11-17", "useful": 4, "type": "review", "cool": 2}, {"funny": 5, "user_id": "B7ecAeAIrXg7sgmabS38pg", "review_id": "RAzbLYbgw3tNv8Tu0R7qmQ", "text": "Hmmm, what to say about Mint.\n\nOkay, if you are a girl and looking for clothes here, I'd say pass.

Ended up backtracking through Brecksville and I remembered an old friend. London Pickle Works! Was it still there some four years after I stopped in while house shopping? Yup. Incidentally, investing in a condo down there probably would have made more sense than buying a house in Lakewood. Live and learn.\n\nCozied up to the bar and ordered a Killians, plus cheesesteak to go(for pooch). Like the Unicorn, food was amazingly done before I could chug my brew. I could get used to this kind of service. The bar was all old men. Matt, I don't know how you do it. They were watching Fox news for chrissakes!! Total was eight dollars! Holy shit. I dropped a three dollar tip on that barmaid's ass. How could I not? A real meal at fast food prices, at fast food speed, served by someone not under house arrest with work privileges. Busted open the styro box. Big sandwich with mushrooms, onions, cheez and beef sliced so thin I swear it was a Steak'um. I never ate those as a kid, but I remember one time my friend had one in his bedroom where we were playing NES. He didn't want it, so we threw it all around the room. Fries were awesome. Also got a pickle. That's eight dollars with the beer, just to recap. Great value, nice location, old men.

Am I missing some sort of cultural significance here? \n\nThe place is dark with small tables, chairs and booths.  It took them ten minutes to hand us the menus after being seated which I thought was incredibly appalling because I'm sure they didn't forget about us.  They have candles on the tables which made it kinda uncomfortable because it seemed too romantic for our own goods (We were hungry and randomly walked into this place).  I ain't gonna lie, the food was good!  We ordered some noodles which tasted like mixed flavors of Chinese and Italian.  Surprise, surprise, it came in a tiny portion that can easily be confused as an appetizer.  WTF mang.  There were just too many selections on the menu (sarcasm) so I ordered an eye roll.  For more than a dub, it's not worth it.  But compared to other rolls I've had at other sushi places, this roll melted in my mouth with just the right amount of flavor, MmmM.

I enjoy watching the Sunday night football game here and enjoying a drink or two.  Last night I decided to grab a bite to eat.\n\nI was dining by myself and wanted some finger food.  After browsing the menu for a few minutes, I decided to go with the Nachos ($10.50).  To wash it down, I had an Iced Tea.\n\nI watched the Giants/Bears game while I waited for my grub......it didn't take too long before it came....the waitress delivered the Nachos and they were a friggin' mountain of Nachos!  (see pics) Seriously.....I'm not opposed to large portions, but damn this thing could easily feed 4 people!  I was a little pissed because I didn't want to eat that much and the waitress didn't say anything.....also the menu didn't mention the gargantuan size of the Nachos either.  I reacted by saying \"Damn, that's a friggin' mountain of food!\".....she replied \"I know\"......well if you knew, why didn't you say something when I ordered it?!\n\nThis is where I am torn....do I knock off a Star because of this?  or not?  I personally feel that it's the server's responsibility to inform customers of stuff like this....especially when they see someone is dining alone and portion size is not mentioned on the menu.\n\nBack to the food....the Nachos were topped with melted Cheddar Cheese, Jalapenos, Guacamole, Sour Cream, Onions, Olives, Tomatoes.  The thing was so massive that stuff was falling off the edges of plate....another faux pas from the server is that she didn't offer me a smaller plate to eat my Nachos.....she expected me to pull pieces off this mountain and have it fall all over the table like a pig.  I tried for a few minutes but felt like a slob so I asked her for a plate, which she brought over right away.\n\nThe Nachos flavor wasn't spectacular, it was bleh.  The Cheese wasn't gooey....it was melted, but seemed to be sitting a little while because it was already coagulating and it was difficult to eat the Nachos without using a fork.  Also, it was top heavy with the toppings....meaning after the 1st layer of Nachos, there was nothing but bare chips in the lower sections.  What's the point of this dish then?  I don't know.....I felt bad because I didn't even come close to finishing it and it wasn't worth taking home......what a waste of food.\n\nI took off 1 Star because of the bad service.....still a great place to catch a game.  I've eaten here many times in the past with great experiences, but was an inactive Yelper at the time so those experiences are outdated.\n\nWill I return?  Because of my favorable history with Big Dog's, I will give them another chance.....next time I'm asking the server how large the portion is.", "business_id": "1Lbq92b6B9z1FYk5mS2R9Q", "stars": 2, "date": "2010-10-04", "useful": 10, "type": "review", "cool": 6}, {"funny": 4, "user_id": "pMefTWo6gMdx8WhYSA2u3w", "review_id": "EiiK6ayw26wEOb3bF8scqw", "text": "Seeing as there are reviews for Dine on L3 (Yorkdale mall) and Urban Eatery (Eaton Centre), I figure I would review the new food court in Square One which is going by the name of \"Food Central\".

I came here because my dearest friend told me to so I did!  I had snooped on their website and blog the week before so I knew I *had* to try the Ferrero cookie on top of some other goods.  Between the two of us, we had a cookie, a lemon bar that was recommended by the friendly barista with the cool hair, a macchiato, and an iced tea.  \n\nThe first sip of the espresso sent me straight onto Cloud 9.  It was rich, fragrant, and creamy.  It made Addiction stir and I was hooked by that vixen.  Girl, I will never give you up again.  The iced tea helped clean the palate as well as that super tasty and tart lemon bar.  Could this be fresh lemon juice?  If it was concentrate, it fooled me.  As for the Ferrero cookie, it was everything I imagined it would be and more.  It was crispy on the edges and soft and delicious in the middle.  Nutella and a very generous amount of hazelnuts decorated the top.  It got a tad too sweet with the ample amount of hazelnut spread but I imagine it being perfect with a foamy latte.  I wish they drew a tiny leaf in my espresso...\n\nThe coffee shop itself is very hipster industrial chic --- wood, steal, a bike, a marquee arrow, a mattress sans the cover and fluff, and glass bottles as lighting. It was very cool.  I like the concrete floors and all the reclaimed wood.  I could imagine a young Joyce sitting here with all her other art student friends, the WP Carey business majors working on their stuffy group assignments on the leather couch and arm chairs, and the regular Tempe resident grabbing a cuppa before work.

Apparently, these were being tested for an upcoming breakfast offering.\n\nI liked the cold brew tasting-- four cold brews of your choosing, for $6.  You then get to choose a 12 oz. pour of cold brew, or opt for any pastry/dessert from the case.  I chose Ethiopian, Apple Jack, Blackberry-Lavender, and Coconut.  Funny how the two I thought I'd enjoy the most (the last two) would be my least favorites!  I'd definitely order the Ethiopian cold brew again, and perhaps the Apple Jack with cream.  The blackberry-lavender was too tart, and I could only detect the berry, which was unfortunate, since I love lavender-scented anything: chocolates/truffles, ice creams/gelatos, shortbreads, soaps, and lotions, etc.  The house-made tiramisu was just OK.  Actually, I didn't eat much of it at the time, since I already had enough milk fat and sugar from the salted creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e coffee here, and I ended up throwing away the leftovers at home that night, since most of the takeaway cup was filled with waxy cream filling.

(Less traffic, not as many obnoxious tourists, etc.)  Also the biggest selling point for me is your proximity to your car.   (you are definitely going to want to rent a car if you stay here, in my opinion)  I absolutely hate the self parking rigamaroo  and subsequent trek through throngs of casino-goers and  miles a dreary, carpeted passageways just to get to your room that is the norm at most of the big hotels.   here you just open your car door and step inside.   it's an old TravelLodge,  so you get the idea of the setup.\n\nSince it is a gay-owned and operated business, there are a few feel-good points awarded for staying here, and supporting the community.   stuff is generally very nice and the owner is attentive, and seems to get what people want.\n\nThere is a nice breakfast spread in the morning including  2-hour coffee, which is a bonus.\n\nThere is a steam room and  kind of seedy  porn watching area,  if you're into that.\n\nCONS:   \n\nDon't go there expecting to meet a porn star.   I'm sure it happens, but this isn't the cast's quarters for Chippendale's, lol.  \n\nIf you want to have guests at the hotel, you sort of have to go  down and let them in at night.   not a big deal, and it makes sense from a security standpoint, but is not as freewheeling as some other places.\n\nIf you are used to staying at the Bellagio,  and need to park next to a Bentley  to get yourself through the day,  skip this place.   as I said, it is campy and fun,  not glamorous or chic.   but at the end of the day, ask yourself... what is Vegas really all about?", "business_id": "8KWWHywMjN-154i_Qi0deQ", "stars": 4, "date": "2010-01-14", "useful": 8, "type": "review", "cool": 4}, {"funny": 3, "user_id": "QQoZeJszS2mWhMRcs5og4Q", "review_id": "GjcERxzREIVo7YIDkTqgHA", "text": "If you are looking for an all men's gay hotel in Vegas, this is your one option and it falls into that tough category of:  because it's gay, we'll stay there to be with our people.  So, we did.  Our first time.  Thankfully, we paid the Sunday night rate and we got that value.  The place as a whole is a little rough around the edges.  Other guests we talked to love the place and return.  We probably wouldn't.  It's the little things: no luggage rack for suitcase, no towel bars for bath towels (install a couple of hooks?), exposed wires on the walls (and extra bunched on the floor) for accent lighting, a foaming soap dispenser at sink and shower (really?  like a truck stop? I'm all for conserving on little bottles and soap bars - install a three-way liquid soap dispenser and that way you can also offer your guests shampoo and conditioner - which they don't now.  $16).  The back stairs that lead to the pool over look areas of junk.  Trash by the pool equipment etc.  So easy to just throw that stuff away.  It's in plain sight of guests and just adds to the attitude of general lack of care.  So, picky?  Well, maybe.  But, these very simple little things are what sets apart hotels and makes for a guest wanting to return.\n\nNow, the good stuff:  the Sunday pool party was very busy and fun.  Maybe 40 men (mostly au natural) sunning and frolicking.  Guests seemed to have a great time (bring your own cooler).  Breakfast was really excellent (a big pleasant surprise!).  Bed very comfortable and linens all nicely clean.  Very friendly and helpful staff.  Free WiFi worked well in the rooms.  Large steam room was nice.  Video room was popular.  And, with the day pass system, you get to mingle with some local boys, too.\n\nSo, for the gay boys who like to roll with the boys, have a great time!  We'll pass next time.

If they had truly thought out their expansion, they would have branched out a while ago and made an \"arts district\" a \"shopping district\" etc.  As it its now, they have no idea what it's supposed to be, but they slapped the \"Mill Avenue District\" name on it to give people the feeling they're living in a real city.\n\nMill's real problem now is that the buildings are too expensive for anyone not representing a giant company to afford.

Of course, nobody carries change nowadays, so I followed the blue sign that read \"Public Parking\" and wound up in the virtually empty parking garage. I spent less than an hour on the street, and when I was leaving the business I'd come to visit, I asked about having my parking pass validated. \"We don't do that any more,\" I was told. \"They took our equipment. Anyway, the first hour's free.\" Back at the parking garage, I was surprised when the attendant in the booth, without a word of greeting, said flatly, \"Two dollar.\" \"Two dollars?\" I asked him, explaining that the first hour was free, at least according to a business owner on the street. \"Two dollar,\" he said again. I had no cash, and told him so. \"Two dollar. Two dollar,\" said the parrot in his little cage. I asked him where I could get cash on the street and he said, exasperated, \"Is two dollar!\"\n\nI backed up (unsurprisingly there was nobody behind me), parked, and, already running late for an appointment, walked to the kiosk at Bank of America, was asked for spare change by a kid lounging on the sidewalk, crossed the street, re-entered the parking garage, drove up to the booth, and again presented my parking pass to the attendant, who now said, without irony, \"Three dollar.\" Evidently it cost another dollar to walk across the street to pay the already extortionate sum of two dollars. Wordlessly I handed him a twenty and, ignoring the faint smile on his lips, left Mill Avenue, this time for good. \n\nThe last time I visited Mill (more than a year ago), I received a $40 parking ticket after having lingered too long in Borders -- another business that I see has pulled up stakes and fled for a more profitable street.

Yesterday the street was virtually abandoned, the storefronts mostly empty, the few people I encountered seemingly killing time between classes at ASU. In short, it was devoid of life. And for this they charge to park? For this they make things as difficult as possible, both for visitors and for the businesses nobody wants to visit anymore? And why would they, when they can visit the same chain stores selling the same items in any mall in America?

DH, who loves carrot cake and could eat a whole sheet by himself could barely swallow a bite.

YUCK.  I split a piece with DD on her insistence.  I ate two bites.  I have to admit I am no pie connoisseur, but this was NOT good.  It was too-sweet, canned cherries in a tasteless crust.  Every cherry pie I have had before has had tart cherries.  I don't know how they got these that sweet, but it was just disgusting.

There were items hand-written into the menu, the elderly waitress made a comment that the \"chef\" was new, and the register was brand new to the waitress as well. \n\nSo, anyhow, the story:\nTwo adults and one child (age of 5). Empty diner except one elderly gentleman who showed up while we were there. The establishment was dirty....don't care. I actually expected it and may have been disappointed had it not been. The waitress needs to retire. She seemed to be struggling stringing sentences together a little. Still, not a big deal. \n\nLet's order!\n\nSo the child of our bunch ordered the spaghetti and meatballs, the adults meals were roast beef and mashed potatoes and gravy as well as swedish meatballs over noodles. \n\nEach meal came with the soup of the day (a creamy spinach soup with whatever those noodles are in wedding soup). I ordered the chili on top of that just to have a taste. The chili was GROSS! Not like a gross like this is too sweet, or too salty, or just not a good recipe....it was GROSS in a way that can only be described as it seemed as though it was so old and re-used or SOMETHING that it developed a taste of nothing with the consistency of cream of wheat. \n\nThe soup of the day came out.....again.....GROSS!!!! Gross for the same reasons except this also had the added pleasure of tasting like they \"of the dayified\" the soup pot by adding a block of salt. VERY gross. I eat EVERYTHING no matter what. I dd NOT eat this.\n\nSpaghetti comes out. Giant portion for a kid but one can't complain about that. Sad-looking but no bog whoop. She enjoyed it.....she's 5. \n\nThe roast beef and mashed potatoes come out. Immediately I see those scooped, starchy, obviously flake potatoes.....no big whoop. Not my cup of tea but they can;t be that bad. The roast beef, however, looked (and I tasted it) and tasted HORRIBLE! It had a gray tinge to it, had the appearance of a texture closer to pencil shavings (only larger) and there was literally zero moisture left in it at all. Gross but let's press on.\n\nWhile that was going on, I heard the waitress speak to the \"chef\" and explained that the Swedish Meatballs over noodles uses egg noodles and not spaghetti noodles and moreover (she didn't use that word I assure you) the \"sauce\" is a brown gravy and not marinara sauce. There was some kind of muttering of acknowledgement and the waitress let me know that there was a problem and that my meal would be out shortly. \n\nThe \"chef\" tried to give me the exact same thing the child across from me had and call it \"Swedish Meatballs Over Noodles\"!!!! Wrap your brain around that! So, after a brief lapse, the plate comes out....unbeknownst to me half my plate had spilled onto the counter during transport and the waitress had used a couple spools to get it back onto my plate before giving it to me. MMMMMMMMM!!!!! Then I look down. It's the same meatballs sitting across from me, the same spaghetti noodles (not egg noodles) sitting across from me with the same brown gravy sitting across from me.....ok, I'm not a debutante...I'll tough it out. \n\nI sliced into the first meatball. I took a bite. It was nearly frozen in the center had a salty briny taste from the gravy that also seemed spoiled. It was gross. The very first time in my years I just pushed a plate away and refused to eat it. \n\nThe waitress came over shortly after and asked how everything was. I let her know that I will kindly pay for these meals but would not feed these things to a stray dog. I let her know this was the first time I ever said this dining out. \n\nShe asked if she could take something off the check? First off, the right thing to do is to just apologize and comp the meal....I wasn't about to debate what should be taken off, get into a mathematics quiz with someone who seems confused that she is even working at a restaurant (again, no offense but she just needs to stop). \nSo we all got up and walked toward the register. This is how we found out that the register is new......\nSo I was charged a little over 20 bucks. I handed the waitress 2-20s and asked if I could just have a 10 back. This was a problem. She could figure out how to open the drawer or use it in any way. She talked to it in disdain and was even starting to have that same kind of demeanor Kathy Bates had in Misery.

Prices are fair and they state that they have lunch specials every day including Saturday and Sunday.\n\nBut, the sides sucked! I ended up not getting anything on the side.   All they had was redskin potato salad and NO mased potatos.  Also, they had 2 kinds of beans and coleslaw...and that was it.  I was kinda dissapointed.  No mashed potatos?  No corn?  ugh!  none!  \n\nOk, and I admit, Im not Martha Stewart (I know you thought I was, but I'm clearing the air on this once and for all that I'm not) but the place looks like it was decorated by a pothead!  Full fledged pothead! Its like cheba hut meets BBQ in this joint!  (no pun intended!)  WTF gives?  I've never been to a BBQ place and seen a life sized Ozzy Ozborne poster hanging on the wall! Its beyond strange!  OMG!\n\nI just couldn't get past the really odd decor! I mean, it was so weird that I actually deducted a star because it was so out of sorts.

You can easily rearrange seating for 2 or more. The middle there's a longer high top table for larger parties. There is also seating in the small bar area at back of restaurant.

Thin strips of tender white chicken and napa cabbage,and rice noodles, the vinaigrette used was perfect for me, just slightly sweet and not too tangy and evenly tossed in the salad.

Tiny pretzel sticks with garlic infused chili oil to dip. \n \nPrices are in the moderate range, I didn't see any lunch hour or happy hour specials.\n  \nService A+ - Friendly and efficient.

It was Destinta at one point, and also had another name before that but I can't remember. Anyways, since my last visit, the building has added a trampoline park, which has the same entrance as the movie theater. Today, my husband and I went to see The Revenant. The movies are the movies, so here is my simple breakdown...\n\nPros: \n~All tickets are $6....except on Tuesdays, which is $4. Not bad at all.\n~The seats are comfortable and the theater was clean.\n~If you had little ones attending a birthday party at the trampoline park (like my niece does all the time at this location), you could - hopefully - keep busy with a movie. There are also two rock climbing walls and arcade type games.\n\nCons: \n~Bathrooms were gross. Water all over the counters, garbage on the floor, etc. I opened one stall door and apparently the toilet had a leak. I deduced this in part to 1) my fine detective skills and 2) a large clear plastic bag that was over the entire back of the toilet and went into a garbage can filled to the brim with dirty toilet water next to it. Why not just put an \"out of order\" sign up?\n~Food and drink prices. Obvious, I know. A medium fountain drink is $4,75, which is just ridiculous. Also, apparently, it is now harder to sneak foodstuff in. There is a sign up at the front door prohibiting bringing in any food or drink and the establishment reserves the right to check your bags. Hmmm I guess the staff was slacking today because they missed my bottled water and bag of pretzels.\n\nAll that being said, ticket prices are still cheap.

We were like, \"Huh?\" It wasn't even busy and the bar wasn't closing. She said we'd have to pay for each drink as we went.

You told us five seconds ago. Holy tacky.\n\nBefore we left, another friend with more cojones than yours truly spoke to our server to politely question the automatic 20% gratuity** based on the level (read: low) of service she received. Even after some back and forth, in an amazing demonstration of the very lack of customer service skills being called out, the server refused to reissue the bill. Seriously? Is the auto-tip on groups here a free pass to be awful? Another girl accidentally double-tipped because of this, too.\n\nI'm not sure what the folks at Geraldine found to dislike about making quick money on a chilled-out group downing pricy drinks for maybe an hour.

Seating is in cramped booths unsuitable for people taller than 6', or at the bar. The interior is hideous: bugly, dated paneling, linoleum and illumination by neon promo signs.

Months that felt like years. But the moment I set foot in that door I immediately felt like I was home. My shoulders relaxed. My breathing eased up. I felt like my soul just got a massage. \n\n....a love song which describes my complete amazement upon walking inside on how much of the old you is still there with the new you. Wallpaper? Check. Lounge seats? Check. Wall fixtures? Lamps? Disco ball? Dancefloor? Low lights (and I mean LOW lights)? Cheap tinsel lining the ceiling? Check x 6. So now the bar is on the left instead of the right, but I don't mind. You're obviously still you, and that's all that matters.\n\n...a love song about the fact that the crowd inside tonight was just like the crowd inside the old you every night. Black, white, brown, yellow, green. It didn't matter then what color you were, and it sure as hell doesn't matter now. Everyone is chill. Everyone is relaxed. Everyone is cool. No airs. No pretense. No scene. Even the huge guy wearing the white full-length fur coat with matching white fur hat and white patent leather shoes and bling on every finger. Coolest, chillest guy in the room - just enjoying himself and having a great time and friendly to everyone. \n\n...a love song which exemplifies the glories of the drinks and the service. Drinks? Still dirt cheap. Service? Still completely & genuinely friendly. Never once makes you feel like for some reason you're not cool enough to belong there.\n\n...a love song which shows my great appreciation for the music. The funk and R&B is back, people. \"Let's Stay Together\", your perennial classic, followed by \"You Dropped A Bomb On Me\", followed by \"Word Up\", followed by \"Don't Stop Till You Get Enough,\" followed by....\"Jailhouse Rock?!?\" Yes, it did happen.

For the first time since I've been in Arizona. 2 years, and it came down to being in the new you to compel me to bust out some moves. Now I wouldn't say I have mad skillz with the way I move. Might be reminiscent of the African Anteater Ritual. But who cares? You never did.\n\n...and last but not least...\n\n...a love song about how you actually came back to me. And to everyone else who loved you. How you simply didn't just throw your hands up in the air and call it quits. How you persisted and moved forward. How volunteers toiled day and night moving as much from your old location to the new one to make everyone feel comfortable from the moment they walked in. How you have truly pulled a Phoenix and have risen from the ashes. How I'll admit that driving by the empty lot on 7th Ave and Indian School was a depressing experience, but no more. \n\nBecause you're back.\n\nBecause you're one of my favorite spots.

Help to overcome lactose intolerance; 2. aid digestion of milk protein: 3. help prevent and combat digestive tract infections. Okay...fro-yo had me at \"overcome lactose intolerance...\" that's all I'm going to say about that! They change their menu of flavors...you know, to mix it up a little...keeps you guessing.

With two moving professionals it took 3.5 hours plus thirty minutes' travel time to the new place. I was anticipating that it'd take less than three hours and would cost about $250 but it ended up costing $400 plus tip. I still haven't figured out the math but that seems like a lot more than I was quoted. Whatever - at least I didn't have to lift a box, right?\n\nThe movers were almost half an hour late but luckily I wasn't in a rush to get out of my current place or into my new one. The two guys, Nathan and Jordan, were very friendly and professional and had done many, many moves before this one. \n\nI'm pretty sure part of the reason the move took so long was because they wrapped so much of stuff in blankets and bubble - a lot of it unnecessarily. The instructions that I gave were basic - nothing was really fragile and certainly nothing was antique or vintage. Just throw it in the truck and let's go. At one point I saw one of the guys wrapping my shitty 1980s 19\" TV as if it was a rare Faberge Egg - this is the same TV that I couldn't shake on Craigslist for $20.\n\nThey didn't bring the standing wardrobes as advertised and also requested - because of this I had to wrap my hanging clothes in garbage bags at the last minute and most of them barely it into my new closet intact - everything kept falling off the hangers and onto the floor. Needless to say this was a huge nuisance. I was most looking forward to seeing this marvel of moving.\n\nThe movers aren't insured to bring you to your new apartment as a passenger in their truck, so if like most people in the city you don't have access to a car, be prepared to take a cab or beg a friend (my method) to drive you to your new apartment. I didn't know about this rule so luckily a friend was able to pull through at the last minute. If the moving company beats you there they won't get started till you arrive so it's worth it to leave a little earlier than they do. \n\nNothing was broken or damaged and I was overall happy with the move - just wish it had taken less time and not been so pricey. Be prepared to spend more than you had anticipated and you'll be OK. \n\nAlso, try to have water or some other beverage handy for the movers - they were sweating up a storm and it was 30C outside (and probably in my apartment as I'd already turned off the A/C), and I had packed all my glasses and had nothing to drink.

Mike Burns was my instructor and he was very interesting and ran a tight ship.\n\nMy class was in the community room at Chandler Fashion Center. The class started at 7:45 and the air didn't kick in until 8:30 and one wall was on the other side of Paradise Bakery. And the music in their kitchen was really loud and someone in there was just singin their heart off. It was distracting and funny at the same time.", "business_id": "A9aM0_VWyeg1SYWXIX28Ig", "stars": 4, "date": "2007-06-17", "useful": 3, "type": "review", "cool": 0}, {"funny": 4, "user_id": "Rs-HbyVraRCP2X4ey1t-IQ", "review_id": "mGC6q5p4V1ebUwFwyWhHCA", "text": "Photo radar doesn't care who you are.

It opened a wee while ago but I just never went out of my way to go. But now I've been in I can't help but imagining my life with more Anthropologie in it. \n\nA beautiful quilted duvet in mist-matched Indian fabrics on my bed perhaps? With the cutest porcelain drawer-handles to replace the old ones on my desk drawers? And the delicious smell of vanilla candles to compliment the equally vanilla perfume on my dressing table? And a beauteous mug full of fresh lemon and ginger tea on the desk, sitting beside the completely unique and individual hand-made leather-bound notebook, containing all the notes for my latest upcoming novel. And beside the gorgeous cup and beautiful notebook, a mismatching (yet so mismatching it matches) china plate that I made using the most stunning yet still practical of kitchen utensils (like a pink spatula, floral bowl, hand-carved wooden spoon) spread with a layer of butter from the pottery butter jar.\n\nYou get the picture.

But I've put the cushion back too straight. This is not a house of straightness. As she bends to re-skew it, back to the perfect angle, just so, I notice the way her dress falls. It's elegant. It's quirky. It's colourful. Oh, for a dress like that.\n\nThe coffee table is laden with enormous books: Berlin. Photography. Seasonal Pies. Spaces... Spaces? They're beautiful, and they don't look like they've ever been opened. They are there to be on the table. The table, likewise, is there to bear their unread weight. A candle in a tin, too, wide, with three wicks, which have never been lit; a fresh, fruity aroma hovers around it all the same.\n\nI turn to comment on the beautiful smell but she's pulling on a patchwork apron over her beautiful dress. It messes up her hair a little bit, improves it somehow. \"Let's make a cake!\" she laughs - that laugh again - and pulls me out into the hall by my arm, starting to make for the kitchen. I wonder vaguely if she ought not to perhaps try making one of the Seasonal Pies instead. I nearly trip over a padded fabric doorstop on my way out, a paisley and polka-dot letter \"A\". Ah. Her name stops doors from closing. Of course.\n\n\"I'm - I'm sorry,\" I stammer, un-straightening the A, checking it for a mark where I've kicked it. No. Thank goodness. \"Actually, I - I have to be heading off again pretty soon.\" I seem in danger of knocking everything, and yet there's so much room here. Spaces.\n\n\"But you never stay!\" she cries, with a playful pout. \"I've got these pecans to use up, you know...\"\n\n\"No, really, sorry, I know, ha. Um.\" I shrug.

Is this the only Cuban bakery in Las Vegas? The sign advertises that they are \"like Porto's,\" where I've never been, but I understand is the west coast standard for Cuban bakeries. I also know that Porto's is approximately the size of the entire island of Cuba, which Roly's certainly is not. I'm from south Florida, where there's a lot more variety and competition for this style of bakery, but I can report that I'm very pleased to have Roly's here in Vegas.\n\nMy first visit (I was driving east on Tropicana and made a right turn with no notice when I saw a sign that said \"cuban coffee\"), I started with my standard order: cafe con leche and a guava-cheese turnover. The turnover was good, but did not fully meet my expectations (a bit dry? not enough cream cheese?), and I was disappointed when my cuban espresso with steamed milk was served unsweetened. In Florida, it is automatically assumed that you want sugar, or they will ask, already fully prepared to pour a full cup of sugar into the hot espresso. Only in Las Vegas, and a small Cuban cafe in Tucson, has my coffee left me wondering, where's my az\u00facar? Sure, I can sweeten it myself, but I don't enjoy the guilty feeling of dumping loads of sugar into my coffee cup. I could continue this rant, but instead I will note that I'm glad that I selected a slice of guava cake to take home, as it tasted fresh and moist and convinced me that Roly's deserved another visit.\n\nThe selections I tried on my second trip were better. I found a slice of the guava strudel more pleasing than the turnover with cream cheese from my first visit, and was introduced to the masareal de coco, two layers of dense, cookie-like cake sandwiched with a sweet coconut filling. I also love the tocinillo de cielo, a dense, yellow flan on top of a layer of sponge cake that helps soak up the caramel syrup. In addition to desserts, Roly's does have a menu of savory options. My husband has tried the traditional pressed sandwich, and said it was OK, but he doesn't have much Cuban sandwich experience for comparison. Having never sampled Cuban pizza, I ordered a veggie, which came topped with fresh spinach, onions, green bell peppers, cheese, and a sweet tomato sauce with a hint of cumin. The crust was more like a thick round of focaccia, so it was a very bready pizza. I'm glad to have tried it once, but probably would not order it again.\n\nPrices are very fair at Roly's: many of the desserts are under $1. Breakfast specials are cheap and worth checking out. Empanadas and papa rellena (those little fried mashed potato balls with a ground beef filling that people seem to be so obsessed with) are also available. Plus, the place is usually packed with Cubans taking multiple boxes of pastries to go. You may wait a bit for counter service, but I think that's a good sign.", "business_id": "ABtCLFoIEH26T2Ij-FQjag", "stars": 4, "date": "2012-06-11", "useful": 7, "type": "review", "cool": 6}, {"funny": 4, "user_id": "eteU71BreWIONFxtIsCP9Q", "review_id": "rshsfm757bJ8klIHIQ8xnw", "text": "I'm happy that my brother, a Las Vegas resident, knows all the decent bakeries in town.

In front of UNLV is an old Strip Mall with Roly's facing campus. It's not much to look at from the outside. And it's not particularly descript on the inside until you look at the display cases full of pastries and the most beautiful cakes.\n\nThe two women working inside didn't speak much English, but I speak enough Spanish that with the menu having pictures and prices, it's no problem. Just point and pay - money speaks in all languages. My brother order a Hamburger.  The burger took about 10 minutes, and it smelled and tasted different in a good way.  There are several different types of burgers, but the regular $6.99 burger is a quarter pound patty, with a Cuban style bun.  Chorizo is blended into the meat patty, and cooked chorizo is part of the  toppings, along with mayo, and red bell peppers, I would give the burger 4 stars. It would be great with an IPA (which Roly's doesn't sell)\n\nPastries were kind of sparse at 5 PM but some good ones were still around. I opted to get a slice of mango cake, with sweet mango topping a white cake and mango puree topping with cream between the layers.. I also got a slice of tiramisu, my favorite thing of all we ordered.  It had a strong cocoa smell from the cocoa powder topping, with whipped cream and white cake layers.  I also enjoyed the guava cheese strudel, but it was a bit heavy and too sweet.  I liked the coconut pastry with the dried sweet coconut paste inside the pastry.  The rolito pastry, rolled yellow cake with pastry, was decent but not as good as the other stuff.\n\nToo bad we didn't taste the cakes.

That's right, I was on the 1st floor, across from the pool, overlooking the parking lot.  Meanwhile the professional lawn bowlers had the penthouse on the 4th floor.

As a lover of spicy foods, I added a comment for it to be hot and spicy just out of past experience with every other Thai restaurant I have eaten at. Well ... I am not about to blame Mango for the 35 dollar price tag to get this single order 2 minutes down the road to my house .. BUT .. The next few hours proved to be an heated experience that I wouldn't wish upon anyone. 2 Litres of water didn't even get me through half the Pad Thai.

I don't need to expand on the extreme pains keeping me up from 4 am to 6:30 that night.\n\nThe next day I wrote to their website and after no reply I went to their restaurant and simply asked them to give me another Pad Thai without the ridiculous heat. They said they couldn't but they would have the Manager call me. .. They didn't call. \n\nI have just got home after a return trip to Mangos and after a lengthy chat with the Manager that included some drivel about \"Racial Profiling\" when I mentioned I never had such heat in a dish from other establishments, their reply was that restaurants would tone down the heat for people like myself. LOL .. OK ... So when you deliver to strangers via take out, you turn the heat back up? I asked myself. .. Here was someone willing to give their restaurant another chance to redeem themselves and I'm in a verbal volley over a 12 dollar dish!\n\nMy theory after they offered me 50% off, was to waive them of my business and to vent a little here. I'm sure their food might be very good but there is a Thai restaurant across the street.

A pain under the left heel had left a ligament that just last year carried me to the summit of Black Mountain, and on the city streets of Chicago was derelict. A ligament that had been so full of energy was a hindrance. A sprint through life had been replaced with a painful limp :'o(  After a few weeks in this condition (which included hiking), I finally came to the decision to see a Podiatrist. I turned to Yelp's podiatrist category. The reviews led me to Apache Foot & Ankle Specialist. \n\n  I took today off from work to see Dr. Lee Wittenberg (abbreviated Dr. W) in his St. Rose Parkway practice. I didn't even know he had an office here until I typed in the direct name (after putting in a duplicate listing that I won't use). This office might as well not exist considering that it is only open on Monday and Wednesday 9 to 12 pm and DOES NOT HAVE AN X-RAY MACHINE (I will repeat this later on). \n\n I arrived in Apache Foot and Ankle Specialists at 9:45 to fill out the prerequisite paperwork for the visit. The receptionist was professional (too bad I could not say this about Dr. W, which I'll talk about soon). \n\n  The introduction to Dr. W's visit, is the receptionist seating me in a chair in back of her desk to measure my blood pressure. It was slightly high (runs on my dad's side of the family). She next led me into the patient's room. \n\n  Dr. W started out professional. He felt under my heel to diagnose the pain. I couldn't feel the pokes & mentioned  it hurt when he turned it. He diagnosed it as Plantar Fasciitis. The pain is from the bottom to the ball of my left foot. The Plantar Fasciitis is one of the major supports for holding up the medical arch of the foot. The next part of a Dr. W visit with a diagnosis of Plantar Fasciitis is building an orthodic arch for the heel. Dr. W's attitude from this point forward would be the Achilles Heel toward my relationship with his practice and word of mouth as expressed in my Yelp. \n\n   A generic health problem was the Green Reaper in Dr. W continuing directly with the treatment. I suffer from the same generic health condition that caused tremors to the left side of my mother and grandmother. God rest their souls. Dr. W turned  unprofessional . He asked me if I have Parkinson's Disease and I will raise my raise my right hand to Heaven that he actually said, \"Do you have any brain damage?\" \"Did you have a stroke? \" This is a moment that I felt my late mother's pain and would have embraced her with a hug if she was here (actually tearing writing this as I think over my mother's pain). The upshot is that Dr. W denied treating me until I see Neurology of Center of Nevada for a condition that I read there is no cure for. \n\n  Now the tears are being replaced by anger. Dr W's\"Orthotics: Eyeglasses for your Feet,\" states the following : \"Orthotics are made in several ways. The patient may be asked to step into a  'foam box, ' which will make an impression of their foot. There is also a computerized version, where the patient stands on a plate and a computer program identifies areas of pressure. Both of these are taken in with the patient standing. \" So why didn't Dr. W have me stand up or strap my shaking left foot? Worst, there was no working x-ray machine in the office. My picture for this business listing shows that he passed on the buck to Pueblo Medical Imaging. I DID NOT TAKE OFF FROM WORK and Pay My DEDUCTABLE OUT of my POCKET To HAVE TO MAKE AN APPOINTMENT FOR X-RAYS THAT IS A CORE RESPONSIBILITY OF A FOOT DOCTOR. Did I break a bone?  This is more critical than a neurotic condition passed on from my grandmother and mother. \n\n   I will give Dr. W one star (would of been zero stars) for the cortisone shot. When you suffer as much I did, the cortisone shot is a pinch. And a band aid approach! \n\n  Dr. W gave me the IMPRESSION that he was in a hurry to get to his Fort Apache Road practice. He gave me a cursory introduction to his stretching and icing instructions for Plantar Fasciitis. I will have to visit a more helpful source:YouTube, to gain an understanding of the exercises. He never said anything professional like,  \"Goodbye, I hope you feel better.\" He never informed me if I am supposed to report to work which demands a lot of walking. \" I did leave with a lighter wallet paying the deductible. \n\n  Dr. Wittenberg's unprofessional attitude and failure to have the necessary equipment necessary in a podiatrist practice is the Achilles heel that prevents anything further than one star. Out of 621 reviews and countless check-ins he is the worst. The upshot is that immediately after this visit, I drove to Foot Solutions for arch supports. DeWitt was the antithesis of Dr. Wittenberg. If this does not work, I will make an appointment with a different podiatrist.

This is a bit tricky if you want to go in to get tested with your new boyfriend (notice I wasn't gender neutral - we all know it's usually the dude who has to be coerced into getting an STD test, right??) but usually you can work it out that you get tested towards the end of the women's hours and they go at the beginning of men's hours. Go grab food at Salad King while you wait for the turnover.\n\nAll testing is FREE and no health card is required. You read that correctly. HIV testing can be anonymous if desired.

You get the results in 5-10 minutes, and if it's positive they follow up with a full blood test to double confirm.\n\nYou get a certification that you are HIV and STI free as of whatever date you were there when you leave - a nice little reference for you to show off.

It was okay. For the main course was a fairly generous serving, minimal amount of chicken and veg and I'd concur it was closer to Quebec stir fry than a tangy tamarind based Pad Thai. It's really hard to find a good PT in Montreal and Quebec. Bangkok in the Fauborg downtown probably does the best version. Otherwise many places do their own stir fry and call it Pad Thai. Not to sound like a Willy Nilly.....but spicy fragrant, flavorful Thai food is nearly non existent in this province.

Hang out at the Circle Bar for a little while, and you're sure to find that it will eventually stumble it's way into your evening.\n\nPeople come to party like rock stars at Hard Rock, and the Circle Bar is (literally) in the middle of it all.  During peak hours, it's a fun place to hang out, and I've learned a few things by frequenting this rock n roll watering hole:\n\n--------------------------------------\n\nHOW TO GET FREE(ish) DRINKS AT THE CIRCLE BAR:\n\n--------------------------------------\n\nIt seems that not many people are familiar with slot comps.  This works at many bars in Vegas, but here's the heads up anyway: If you play those video poker/blackjack machines at the bar, the bartender will comp your (non top shelf) drinks (one at a time).  Here's how to do it:\n\n-  Put at least $20 into the machine.\n-  I recommend also putting your Rockstar Player's Card into the machine (hey, why not build some comp dollars towards food while you're earning your free drinks??).\n-  Play video blackjack.  The video poker odds are more stacked against your goal of breaking even or possibly winning.\n-  Play at least $1 per hand.  The bartenders will likely enforce this if you want the free drinks.  If you don't like gambling in general (or not on a machine); play slow, or take your bet down to 25 cents when the bartenders aren't looking.\n-  They'll put a glass in front of you with your comp receipt.  Put your tips in the glass.  Tip at least a dollar or two per cocktail, as you get them.  Don't be one of those cheapos that tries to tip at the end.  If they see the dollar bills filling that glass, they'll keep coming back and offering you more drinks.\n\n--------------------------------------\n\nTHE (alleged) CONCAVE/PARABOLIC CEILING PHENOMENON \"ICE BREAKER\"\n\n--------------------------------------\n\nBecause the ceiling high above the Circle Bar is of a round, concave shape, sound allegedly will strangely bounce around, and travel from one side of the bar to the other.  Some have claimed to be able to clearly hear conversations on the other side of the large bar, even though the music and crowd are very loud.\n\nI watched my friend doing quite well with a young lady at the bar by explaining this phenomenon.  He looked pretty silly trying to predict what people on the opposite side of the bar were ordering; or actually running over to the other side to speak to her and prove his theory.  I personally couldn't hear what he was saying, but she ate it up.\n\n--------------------------------------\n\nThe Circle Bar is a good time!  The amount of trouble you get into (or avoid for that matter) is really up to you.  You have been warned.

Yep.  No bullsh-t.\n\n\"MY CIRCLE BAR STORY\"\nI was buying drinks for our party of 16 and she and a friend showed up out of the blue and coincidentally, she worked for the same company I worked at, except in a different geography.  Buzzed out of my mind while turboboosted by liquid courage & Red Bull, I kicked it into gear:\n- I started in with some of my funniest stuff.  Meh. She wasn't having any of it.  \n- I offered her a drink from my cocktail tray of mirth.  Zippo - not interested.  \n- I tried doing the \"tell-me-about-you-cause-I'm-an-interested-and-caring-listener\" thing.  Nope - no play.   \n- I tried the \"outrageous-lie-to-catch-her-attention\" thing.  Crashed & burned.  \n(Dammit.  The playbook was getting thin and I was doing so poorly, I still didn't even formally have her frickin' name. )\n\nFinally, I used my trump card:  Based on her name (which I eventually caught when her friend who was having a grand ol' time, called her name outloud) and the division she worked for, I figured out who she was based on emails I'd seen from her.  So, I started criticizing her division of the company, rambling on, calling them a \"waste of money\"  that added little value.  Now THIS got her attention, but before she had the chance to say something back, I said, \"Yeah, but there's one person that seems to do a pretty good job and that's this girl [her full name].  She published content for us that's actually useful to our team and otherwise does an awesome job.\"  \n\n...Astonished, she exclaimed, \"Th... th... that's ME!\"  Yep.  No joke.  This sandlot play actually worked.  We dated for 2 years long distance until she moved in with me, and we've been married ever since.\n\nSo now why would you want to check out the Circle Bar at the Hard Rock?\n\n1) \"NOW WE'RE IN... THE BIG LEAGUES\"\nDepending on what time you go, you can either have a really beautiful crowd, or a sausagefest that's usually the remnants of a much better timeblock an hour ago.  If it's the latter, walk yourself over toe Mr. Lucky's and order the off-menu $7.77 special instead.  You'll spend less money and have more fun.  Otherwise bring your A-game and your best hook otherwise you'll be like a mosquito repeatedly bouncing off a screen door, unable to get in.\n\n2) BARTENDERS\nThe bartenders are quite easy to get an order to.  Unlike other places, I've found that it's not difficult to get their attention, and they won't flip out if you order a Mojito for your girl.  I guess they're just used to moving really fast to sate people's thirst.\n\nNOTE:  \"KEEP AWAY FROM THE BLACKJACK ALCOVES\"\nThere are alcoves that line the outside of the Circle Bar that face inward.  These serve up some of the worst kinds of Blackjack known to man.  $25 min 6-5 Single Deck.  You have to be doing pretty poorly at the bar to wander over to the Blackjack tables on the rim to try your luck.\n\nCONCLUSION:\nThe bar's nothing spectacular however the gravitational pull it has on Hard Rock ladies after hours gives it a little something extra.  3 1/2-stars plus 1/2-star for being the place I met my wife.\n\n4-stars.\n\n--------------\nINSIDER'S HINT:  THE PARABOLIC BAR CEILING\nIf you feel like there's someone talking right next to you but no one's there, don't freak out.  It's not \"the Ghost of the Circle Bar\".  The fact is that the ceiling of the Circle Bar is like an experiment at the Science Discovery museum:   It's shaped just such that if you're sitting on one side of the bar, it's often (not always) possible to sometimes clearly hear conversations going on directly on the opposite side of the bar.  The result is eerie:  It's as if the voice is right next to you, behind you, or even in front of you - but no one's there.  There's of course the added value of being able to eavesdrop on those directly across from you...", "business_id": "FxhPnGuHqLHkBX9p1jm06Q", "stars": 4, "date": "2009-01-18", "useful": 2, "type": "review", "cool": 2}, {"funny": 3, "user_id": "dHF1L4KlTRSwY5CyK1XP6w", "review_id": "CaYk2f7ss9DgVslnRlwB3A", "text": "Just because it's pretty doesn't mean it's good! \n\nIf you don't mind the repeated insulting MONTHLY intrusion of a cleaning inspection than this place is for you!! \n\nI rented here knowing about the apartment inspection thinking , well I'm clean that won't be a problem. Too bad, this process is made to be as difficult as possible and it sucks. This property manager is into intimidation and insults, it doesn't matter how clean you are. She must get a high doing this because it's the same each time even if she knows my apartment will be clean.\n\nI plan on not answering the door next time and when she enters I will ignore her.\n\nThe manager runs her hands on your appliances, I'm thinking about putting cooking oil on the appliance surfaces so she runs her hand into it. She threw her hands in the air and asked me if my kitchen sink works then runs the water to be sure just in case I missed that detail, she sniffs loudly enough for you to hear at the kitchen sink, the sink is of poor quality and water stains don't scrub out but she sticks her head in it to see all angles, she gives everything an up and down and up and down look. This behavior comes off as, \"What can I take next time I'm in the mood to shop through \"my\" apartments.\" \n\nI am laying out my white gloves and getting a magnifying glass from the dollar store for the next inspection. I know that will bring more rude comments and extreme behavior but it will be so much fun to watch her react to it like she tries to get me to react to her quizzes and grotesque moves of intimidation. \n\nI had a visitor have trouble getting in the front door. The manager yells and slammed things around on her desk because my guest needed her help in the door, not once but 4 times. They won't come during the day any longer. I would go to that extreme too. I'll bet she is good at whack a mole because that is also what she has done when I was in her office. She should color code those files so she doesn't loose them while she slams them around.\n\nThis is the deal breaker for me. I have tried to avoid her, but I'm not leaving my apartment just so she can be in my apartment alone. I have tried to avoid her by sitting on the couch in the livingroom but now she comes in here and looks at everything in my livingroom up and down, up and down. Not too many people are going to qualify living here and now the clean, pay rent on time, tenants are target for insults and rude behavior. I have never seen more people move out then move in at any apartments where I have lived. After I was here for 2 months I started asking other tenants why is everyone moving out. I was just given head shakes or told \"you'll see\". I guess they knew I would find out sooner than later.\n\nI think the next inspection I'll tell her that I know she is the meanest, most intimidating apartment manager of all time and I just tremble to think she will be in my apartment. Maybe that will increase the thrill for her.\n\nToo bad you shouldn't have to be insulted and intimidated living anywhere.\n\nIf and when things improve this review will come down.", "business_id": "1s-R850FG00E7lH7qrGvtA", "stars": 1, "date": "2015-10-28", "useful": 4, "type": "review", "cool": 2}, {"funny": 3, "user_id": "YJ-iV-Go-tW4LS5Oggkg6g", "review_id": "Tf51IgNvBflZxE5mrpx9mQ", "text": "Inexpensive, close to everything in Tempe living.

Das Essen war das krasse Gegenteil... \n\nEnglische Kochkunst ist im Allgemeinen wirklich keine sehr ruhmvolle Angelegenheit und zu allem \u00dcbel war die Gastmutter eine grauenhafte K\u00f6chin. Ausz\u00fcge gef\u00e4llig? \nFifty Shades of Pfefferminzsauce (oder versehentlich eine Schachtel After Eight mitgekocht?) \nHalbrohe Ofenkartoffeln mit einer rauen Menge Butter, Salad Cream und Thunfischmatsch bekleckert... \nUnd nein, ein Blatt Eisbergsalat, ein Schnitz Paprika und eine Cocktailtomate sind KEIN Salat! Auch nicht, wenn man Salad Cream dr\u00fcberleert!! \n\nH\u00e4tte man mir damals gesagt, dass ich freiwillig ein englisches Gesch\u00e4ft betrete, h\u00e4tte ich vermutlich den Vogel gezeigt. Letzten Montag habe ich es getan... und sogar freiwillig! Die Zeit heilt bekanntlich viele Wunden und so blieb im Hirn zwar der dezente Grusel zu Pfefferminzsauce und Salad Cream erhalten, aber es kamen auch positive Erinnerungen zutage. Scones zum Beispiel - wahlweise mit Rosinen und gesalzener Butter, oder \"Normale\" Scones mit Clotted Cream und Erdbeermarmelade... Auch Baked Beans mit Bratkartoffeln sind durchaus lecker. \n\nIch war eh in Stuttgart und vom Schlossplatz aus l\u00e4uft man knappe f\u00fcnf Minuten bis zum Piccadilly, das ein wenig versteckt hinterm Variet\u00e9 Friedrichsbau liegt. Den Weg kannte ich, das Piccadilly war schnell gefunden. Schon von Ferne gut lesbar prangt der Schriftzug English Shop \u00fcberm Eingang. \n\nDie Schiebet\u00fcren \u00f6ffnen sich... Wow, Union Jacks \u00fcberall.. Auf Postern, Tassen, W\u00e4nden. \u00dcberall. Und Bl\u00fcmchen... Kleine Bl\u00fcmchen, gro\u00dfe Bl\u00fcmchen, bunte Bl\u00fcmchen. \u00dcberall. Englisch-Kitsch at it's best. Zwischen all dem stehen die ersten beiden K\u00fchlregale - eins mit fifty shades of Cheddar und eines mit fifty shades of ale und beer. Die Union Jacks filtert das Hirn schon nach einer halben Minute v\u00f6llig aus. Hier im Eingangsbereich finden sich massenweise englische B\u00fccher, englische Zeitschriften und Anglophilen-Devotionalien aller Art. \n\nIch schleiche vorbei an Teek\u00e4nnchen und Teet\u00e4sschen mit Bl\u00fcmchenprint und steuere den hinteren Ladenteil an, denn hier gibt es Whisky. Das Angebot ist kolossal! Die gr\u00f6bste Einteilung ist Scotch und Single Malt, dann ist nach L\u00e4ndern und schlussendlich nach Herkunftsregionen innerhalb der L\u00e4nder sortiert. Data Overflow. Unterhalb eines jeden Whiskys ist ein K\u00e4rtchen angebracht, das Geschmack und Herkunft en Detail beschreibt. Vor einigen der Preise erstarrt man in Ehrfurcht und stellt die Flasche danach seeeeeehr behutsam ins Regal zur\u00fcck. Auf Wunsch kann man sich einige der Preziosen auch in kleine Fl\u00e4schchen zu 2cl, 5cl und 10 cl abf\u00fcllen lassen. Ich w\u00e4hle eine Flasche zw\u00f6lf Jahre alten Bowmore von der Insel Islay und gucke mich weiter um.\n\nIn etlichen Regametern reihen sich allen aneinander, was das Hirn geflissentlich verdr\u00e4ngt hatte. Salad Cream (inklusive Varianten), Mixed Pickles, komische Saucen, Marmite, Vegemite, eigenartige Nudelsnacks und Baked Beans... Letztere ebenfalls in seltsamen Ausf\u00fchrungen (mit W\u00fcrstchen, Barbecue-Style und tats\u00e4chlich auch in der Variante \"hundsgew\u00f6hlich\"). Ein kurzes Gr\u00fcbeln, ein Griff zur Dose. Variante \"hundsgew\u00f6hnlich\" darf mit. \n\nUnsummen englischen S\u00fc\u00dfkrams reihen sich ebenfalls aneinander. Fifty shades of Shortbread (vulgo auch \"Kalorien in Dosen\" genannt), massig grauslige Schokolade. Als Mitbringsel f\u00fcr eine Pfefferminzschokoladenbegeisterte greife ich zu Pfefferminz-Luftschokolade, eine weitere Schokolade mit ganzen N\u00fcssen wird ebenfalls eingepackt. \n\nIn der Getr\u00e4nkeabteilung gibt es alles von Rang und Namen... Ein Dutzend verschieder Ales, Ciders und Biere wartet auf Abnehmer. Dazu der unvermeidliche Getr\u00e4nkesirup, der, meiner Meinung nach, nach Waschmittel schmeckt und einige englische Limonadensorten in klickibunten Farben. Auch hier ist die Auswahl riesig. \n\nIch schleiche zur Kasse. Dort steht eine englische Dame, die freim\u00fctig w\u00e4hrend des Kassiervorgangs mit einer Freundin telefoniert. Mit einer Hand wird kassiert, die Bezahlung mit EC get\u00e4tigt. Bis zum Schluss legt sie nie das Telefon aus der Hand. Das finde ich ein wenig schade... ich habe fr\u00fcher selbst nebenher im Einzelhandel gearbeitet und das geh\u00f6rt sich einfach nicht. Immerhin war das Gespr\u00e4ch ladenpassend in Originalsprache ;) \n\nF\u00fcr die Telefoniererei gibt es einen Stern Abzug, ansonsten ist der Laden nett und hat eine sch\u00f6ne Auswahl englischer \"K\u00f6stlichkeiten\" parat. Die Whisky-Auswahl ist klasse. Barrierefrei ist der Laden auch und auch Parkpl\u00e4tze gibt es in der N\u00e4he (allerdings kostenpflichtig).

That kind of stuff. They've also got lots of his artwork (reproduced) adorning the walls all around the entrance. \n\nOnce inside, there's a very small gallery with moving walls where you can see some rare prints that are available for purchase. Additionally, they've got a gift shop that is loaded with Jones merch, from stuffed animals to coloring books, magnets, salt-and-pepper shakers.... there's plenty. \n\nUnfortunately, that was pretty much where our \"experience\" ended. The tour, which neither woman working the front counter seemed interested in getting us to do, costs $20. I know that may seem like a pittance, but based on prior reviews - and checking it out a little myself - it seems like we'd have been paying $20 a piece to walk through  a maze of art.

We went with a few a la carte dishes.  We started out w/ the Hamachi which was a beautiful slice of hamachi over a piece of grapefruit and avocado.  Tako and Tomato was next and that might have been my favorite.  They grilled the tako, put it over home-made mozzarella on top of a piece of tomato all topped w/ wasabi oil.  It was so flavorful and had a great consistency.   We then tried the Soft Shell Shrimp Fry which was ok but I didn't think that special.  We then moved on to the White Fish Carpaccio which was thinly sliced fish cooked in garlic oil.  This was very good, very unique, and surprisingly not greasy.  This dish was also served w/ some homemade bread to dip in the oil.  \n\nI think I could have kept eating everything on the menu but we moved onto dessert which was a great ending.  I tried the tofu chocolate dessert which was very good and very thick.  I was lucky enough to try the banana dessert as well which, even if you don't like banana desserts... you should try because it was that good.  \n\nWhen you go, don't forget to try the mixed drinks...

With so many good things to choose from, it was a tough choice for me but since I had just come from a gym workout I decided to go with one of the favorites: the superbiotic, and I ordered mine with gluten-free crust rather than their regular 10-grain crust. I loved how the individual flavors stood out - garlic, artichoke, red onion, cilantro, peppers ... a true gustatory (and healthy) delight! The crust was just a tad overly firm at the edges but that is a common characteristic of baked goods made from gluten-free dough, since wheat gluten is what gives baked goods their \"springy\" texture.

We just went with the cheaper option because the seafood one didn't seem too enticing. \n\nThe options were plentiful as the menu had just about everything you could think of for hot pot. They had a nice variety of meat too with lamb, beef, pork, chicken, and even beef tongue. Be careful not to order too many at once as the portions on each plate are mighty hefty (Not sure if it was because there was 4 of us or not). The meat were all pretty tasty. The broth is what really makes hot pot and they did a fine job. Not the best I've ever tasted, but it wasn't bad at all. The normal broth (don't know if it has a name) was pretty bland and was meant more for veggies. The spicy broth wasn't overly spicy but was definitely the better one of the two and it started to overflow with all the stuff we were mercilessly throwing in there.\n\nFor the price and the variety of meats, I thought the place was A-Ok.

They used to have an \"atomic\" wing challenge, where you would sign a liability waiver then have to eat a dozen extremely hot wings. If you could eat all of them you would receive a shirt and your picture on the wall. Last time I was in Sports Peppers all of the pictures were off the wall and the atomic wing challenge was gone, but I believe their hottest wings are still just as spicy.\n\nSince the wings still exist and I did their old atomic wing challenge, let me explain to you how hot the wings were for anyone crazy like me who wants to test their manhood. Let me say beforehand that I can eat a ton of spicy foods. Suicide wings at most every place around town are not a problem to eat. They are enjoyable and do not resemble a challenge or anything too spicy. I figured this \"challenge\" would be easy. It was not.\n\nWhen the plate arrived, the fumes launched a barbaric attack on my nose. I cringed knowing what I might be in for. But hey, any loser cook can make wings smell hot. Actually making them hot is something different. I took the first bite. No sweat. I made a sarcastic remark to my friends, thinking about how awesome I am, probably something along the lines of, \"This shit is a joke. Too easy.\" Well, like most really hot foods, these wings take awhile before they really hit you. When they do hit, have some fucking milk nearby. \n\nSooner or later I finished all of the wings. I was victorious. Except for a couple of things. First of all, my mouth was numb. I drooled on myself a couple of times. My eyes were watering. When I got home, I lived in the bathroom for awhile and produced some utterly vile waste. To be honest, I don't think I ate wings for ~6 months after this challenge. This little sports bar taught me that I'm not the spicy food god I thought I was.

I could sense out of the corner of my eye that he was staring at me for what seemed like a good solid five minutes after I sat down.

I was one of the handful of honkies there, which included on old biker dude, and two guys and a girl in their 20's or so.  Most everybody was relaxed and all smiles, just having a good time playing pool and socializing as an assortment of Nightranger tunes played on the jukebox.\n\nThe decor was indeed pretty divey, wood veneer paneling on the walls (is wood veneer paneling even manufactured anymore?), christmas lights strung about here and there, the standard dive bar issue string O' promotional flags.

I had been meaning to make it down there, but due to my career choice of Wage Slave (not as glamorous as it sounds) I hadn't been able to make it out to Food Truck Friday.  Food trucks are so hot right now.\n\nAfter perusing my choices of sustenance (BBQ, Hot Dogs, Po Boys) I found myself in front of a white and orange sparkly GMC.  It was the Sunshine & Spice truck.  I was intrigued with the options of stuffing rather traditional Asian fare into a burrito or taco.  The idea of teriyaki beef, or curry chicken in a California style burritos sparked my interest, but I settled in on a mushroom burrito, a pink lemonade, and apple pie wanton (oh, they joy).\n\nThe burrito was a decent size for the price, but it was when you started maowing on it that you discover that it is a hearty wrap of tummy stuffing awesome.  You know how sometimes you get a burrito that contains rice, that turns into a rice burrito?  Not the case here.  Plenty of killer to the proper amount of filler.  Speaking of filler, the mushrooms worked as flavor sponge for the soy marinade.  Tasty town.  The home made guacamole had a nice way of pulling it all together.  The wasabi sauce was really what drew me in to ordering the mushroom burrito in the first place.  It added a very interesting flavor that set it apart from anything in the burrito/wrap lineage that I have ever put inside me.  It was awesome... except for one bite where it kicked me straight in the sinuses.  If you have gotten a bonus glob of wasabi when eating sushi, you know how it will wake you up.  Woah.  Other than the one bite that went rogue, it was good gastro-times.\n\nThe pink lemonade was pink lemonade.  Wouldn't deserve a mention if the fiery redhead who took my order didn't ladle a few strawberries into my beverage.  Nothing makes you feel more like a man than fruit in your drink.\n\nNow we come to the best part of my food ingestion experience.  Apple pie wontons with whipped cream.  There isn't anything that you can fry that I won't eat (I proved that on a sex tour of the orient a few years back).  If a crab wonton raped a McDonald's Apple Pie from the 80s (not this baked crap they have been trying to pass off), this would be the love child.  Evidently, Goldschlager would be the god father, because this baby sparkles.  No, literally.  There was gold sparkles on my dessert.  I felt so opulent.\n\nIt reminded me of a Chappelle show skit.

I met a friend for dinner on a Wednesday.\n\nHaving just received their liquor license, there were only two red wines and one white available by the glass.  My companion ordered the merlot and I had the cab sauv - both were good.  The menu is very reasonable - with entrees from about $10-25 and apps and desserts from $6. (The menu is available online - these prices are just from memory.)  We ordered lamb chops and moussaka, then for dessert - all were very good.  The only disappointment was that the espresso machine was not installed and I could not have an Americano with the rich, creamy trifle.  I settled for brewed coffee (which could have been fresher, but since the meal was so good and for such good value - I couldn't complain).\n\nI have reserved my comments about the service because it was so curious to me that an established restaurant owner (the folks who own Panache have a long history in Toronto) would hire the server we had.    He was not only inexperienced (which is forgivable), he was so obtrusive it became almost comedic.  In fact, it was like being served by Basil Fawlty on a bad day (minus the actual laughs).

Then, he forced us to split the bill down the middle - halving it and entering the amount into the hand-held credit card machine without asking.  He also stood over us while we sorted out a tip.

The girlfriend, J, and I checked into the hotel after a long ordeal at the Pittsburgh airport and we were both excited to try this steakhouse that everyone between Pittsburgh International and the front desk raved about. Hey we like steak and it seemed to be just what we needed to feel normal again. \n\nIt was only 7:30 PM when we walked to the restaurant but there was no one there. Were they open? Is there another place where we should look for a host or hostess? Eventually a waitress strolled out from what we assumed was the kitchen area and asked us if we needed help. We asked if they were open and she gave us a funny look. Not backing down we starred at her until she admitted they were. \n\nWe were allowed to choose our own seat and since there were no other diners to give us any competition we chose a window seat that gave us a view of the Monongahela River. The waitress/hostess handed us menus and I requested the wine list. \n\n\"It's on the table.\", was her response. \n\nOh, how silly of me not to realize the laminated card that had the happy hour drink specials was also the wine list. Who was running this operation, Chili's? As soon as the waitress was out of earshot I whispered to J, \"Order something different from me because that lady is definitely going to spit in my food.\" \n\nIf memory serves me correctly there was a bottle of Opus One on the wine laminant for $300 or so and then all of the other bottles were less than $35. Talk about two extremes. I did a little restaurant math and figured the Opus One was for the poor business traveler that was booked into this horrible hotel and wanted to exact revenge on his or her company by abusing his or her expense account privileges. Call me crazy but this didn't appear to be the type of restaurant that had proper cellar facilities for a wine the caliber of Opus One so it was eliminated right away from our vino option. \n\nThe other wines were a little foreign to us as well. I knew the varietals but some of the appellations were new to me. The state of Pennsylvania is part of four American Viticulture Areas (a fact I learned after I returned home) and as much as I am up for trying new and unusual wine I was leaning towards the token offering from the southern hemisphere. \n\nThe waitress returned to see if we had any questions about the menu. I asked what she thought of the Shiraz. She then gave me the same look I received when I asked if they were open. Not wanting to go through another starring contest I quickly pointed to the wine laminant and humbly said, \"This one. I might not be pronouncing it correctly.\" (I was). \n\n\"Oh, it's lovely and one of our best sellers.\" \n\nWell at least if it sold well we reduced our risk of it being an old bottle that had already turned into vinegar. \n\n\"We'll take one of those please.\" \n\nWe still had high hopes for the steaks. J ordered the filet and I ordered the rib-eye. The waitress explained to us that Pittsburgh rare is a method of cooking the steak where it is flash seared and charred on the outside and blood red rare on the inside. I decided to try Pittsburgh Rare because how bad can it be if they went to the trouble of naming the restaurant after the cooking method, right? I even went for the off the menu topping of caramelized onions and reduce balsamic vinegar as my topping. For my side I chose the mac & cheese. \n\nThe steak was good, in fact it was very good and I was happy with the Pittsburgh Rare preparation. Sure it was a little bloody and turned my mac & cheese a pink color that J called disturbing, but it tasted great. Even the wine wasn't as bad as I expected and as far as I can tell my entree was loogie free. \n\nWe skipped dessert but they brought us out what J and I called a seafoam-colored cloud of cotton candy. This was by far the best cotton candy I have ever had. The only way I can describe it is to imagine the flavor of green Lifesavers in the cotton candy format. It was the highlight of the weekend. \n\nWould I recommend Pittsburgh Rare? Yes. As long as you bring your own bottle of wine, like your steaks rare and understand going into the restaurant that this is a step up from the Outback's and Black Angus' of the world but no where near the caliber of the critically acclaimed steakhouses that true beef enthusiasts love.", "business_id": "Es0JayHVN_XPn1q5yFtn6g", "stars": 3, "date": "2009-02-04", "useful": 4, "type": "review", "cool": 3}, {"funny": 4, "user_id": "K-tV497IGYVLrMSmLZzU7A", "review_id": "hgC2O9ogMNSzDndB1LcJlg", "text": "Hier einkaufen gehen ... k\u00f6nnte zur puren Verzweiflung ausarten ... :(\n\nIn einem Sonderprospekt hatte der Markt einen Akkubohrschrauber inseriert, der um die H\u00e4lfte g\u00fcnstiger war als der, den ich vor einigen Tagen im hiesigen Baumarkt gekauft habe.

I ordered a pasta dish and my fabulous wife ordered a surf' n 'turf special with a lobster tail and an 8 oz filet mignon.\n\nNext time I'm getting that.  I told our waiter Anthony that I don't really like steak but I would come back for that steak.  Since I would order it medium well, how would they prepare it?  Anthony told me that in that case they would butterfly the cut so that it could be done to my satisfaction yet retain its tender juiciness.  And the lobstah?  I lived in New England for about 3 years before arriving in Phoenix...I've had lobstah that is moments from the boat.  Verona served up a pretty good lobstah tail, particularly considering we are in the middle of the desert.

Lovely. I couldn't get enough!\n\nI ordered the 12oz Rib eye with Squash w/pancetta for $25. I was very specific with my steak. I ordered it pan-roasted to medium and finished with butter, served with a side of blue cheese. And I got it medium and grilled on the salamander. I was disappointed when it first hit the table, and then I took a bit... oh em.. gee!!! \n\nNever, EVER - have I had a steak THIS good!! Tender, perfectly chard, flavorful, beautifully seasoned and well rested. The sign of any great steakhouse is in how well they rest their steaks before serving. I couldn't believe it was so amazing... but I can't help but to wonder how it would have been if I got it the way I wanted it! I also can't help but to wonder if the chefs in the back knew better than me! I did tell the server that the order was wrong... but that I was happy and didn't need to have it fixed or replaced. She was relieved and waited on us hand and foot afterward. \n\nMy mom got the Special. An 8oz Filet Mingon with asparagus, roasted potatoes and eggplant ragu for $27! She ordered it well done! (ARGH!

I remember the very date this theatre opened -- December 18th, 1998 -- mostly because I was scheduled to work there.

It's often while I'm traveling, which is probably because (a) you're in a more desperate, survivalist state when you don't have your bearings and therefore unexpected discoveries seem more miraculous, and (b) when I travel I visit almost exclusively the historic downtown core of any place, which is usually where everything magical resides. \n\nNow, I may be the only person in the world who travels to Las Vegas to visit the historic downtown core, but this is who I am and you're just going to have to learn to deal with it. Also, fuck the Strip. It's the same shitty middleamerican crowd, it's just more expensive and larger scale, which are shitty middleamerican things anyway.\n\nBack to the historic downtown core thing, they appear to be doing some civic redevelopment stuff in the \"East Fremont Street\" area. So when LB and I were traipsing around in the 105 degree heat admiring historic neon signs and abandoned wedding chapels, and we noticed a big sign across from the El Cortez for \"MEX/CUBAN FOOD\", I knew immediately that a travel miracle was upon us. And it was. \n\nFirst of all, it is the cutest fucking place you have ever seen. From the neon signage to the bright pink and gold chairs and pleather booths to the waitresses' dresses, it makes you want to kill yourself for ever having eaten at a crappy Chevy's. It's the real deal. It also has a giant big screen TV upon which we witnessed the following: latin music videos on \"htv\" (hispanic tv? anyway, h-urbano was our favorite channel), music videos featuring booty shaking ladies and armadillos, and - this is for real - a DVD concert series of recent performances by KC & the Sunshine Band, Wild Cherry, and the Trammps. Now, if you know me, you know that disco music is the way to my heart. So Mamacita's, you had me at Play That Funky Music Whiteboy. But I'm not sure you had the large Mexican family eating at pushed-together tables, because they were not stoked when you turned off the Urbano. Also, I should add that the sound system is first rate, and I think at night it turns into a dance club. Sweet.\n\nSo, we also learned, \"Mex/Cuban\" does not mean a mishmosh of two cuisines. Apparently the owner (?) is Mexican, and her husband is Cuban, which means they have two distinct menus, one for each cuisine. Which results in more delicious choices for you, the customer. I would recommend ordering everything under \"side orders\" and a Cuban Sandwich. That's what I did. You may want to play it more on the healthy side and order the vegetarian fajitas, or the avocado salad. I know this because I ate those, too. Also, make sure to get the yuca. It comes two ways: fried, and in an oily roasted garlic sauce. I mean, you might as well get both of those, too. I'm not going to lie and say we didn't.  You can also get an entire roasted tilapia, if that's your thing. We actually didn't order that. \n\nAnyway, the point is that the food in Vegas is so generally shitty that when you're ready for a meal that doesn't involve processed lunch meat or $0.99 shrimp cocktail, Mamacita's is there for you, so be ready to EAT.\n\nAlso, the ladies serving you are pretty much the nicest people I've ever met, so if you are one of those assholes that is rude to cab drivers and waitstaff, please don't go in here because I will be forced to break knees.\n\nThe customer base is eclectic. A nice mix of latin families, oddly misplaced white people and the local street characters, of which there seem to be many on this part of East Fremont.

I had never had Cuban food at a restaurant so I was a bit clueless on what certain things were. \n\nI asked the waitress what the house specialty is or what is ordered the most and or popular, she then points out a few things on the menu and says this is OK, um that is OK. Well you know what lady, I am looking for more than just \"OK\". \n\nCrappy service for starters, after finally coming to take our order it took another 15 minutes or so to get our drinks. The food took forever, and only two of four meals were brought. So I am sitting waiting until my friends food comes so I can eat. I said screw it, my fajitas are getting cold waiting so I dug in! \n\nAfter the non helpful suggestions from the waitress, I decided to play it safe and ordered the beef and chicken fajitas which came with a side plate of rice and beans. The fajitas were a large portion of dry unseasoned chicken and beef. Not much flavor at all to speak of. I have had better fajitas at El Torito's. Disappointment for me as even the rice and beans were bland, very bland! \n\nFriend #1 ordered a bowl of menudo, she said the flavor was not the best and she is an old school menudo eater. She asked the waitress prior if it their menudo had a red or white base, the waitress pulled the menu and pointed to the picture and said that is what it looks like. Also her plate was a sloppy mess when it arrived, menudo juice all over the plate and running down the side of the bowl, the presentation was just bad. I know they were rushing to get orders out but there is just no excuse for that slop to be dropped at anyone's table. I attached a picture, check it out.\n\nFriend #2 got the Tequila pollo dish with a side order of chile releno. The chicken was one big slab on the plate, would have made a better eater friendly and a visually appealing meal had they sliced it. The portion was generous but did not matter as the taste once again was bland as the other dishes we tried. \n\nFriend #3 got some sort of beef dish that was nothing but grizzle, all she was able to eat was the white rice and the black beans she spit up.

We will NOT be back. \n\nAlso the flat screen TV blasting the Michael Jackson videos, over and over and over and over and over was overkill. We could not hear each other so we had very little conversation between the four of us. \n\nA hilarious moment, the waitress walked past our table and because the music video was soooooo freakin loud the waitress did not even hear my friend calling her! We just wanted to ask if they could turn it down. Several other patrons were talking about it as well. Ok they were not talking about it as I could not hear anyone, I mean I was lip reading along with watching people point to their ears so I am assuming they were thinking the same as we were that the music was way too loud. Don't get me wrong...music is my life but when I dine I am not really down for a taped concert at the same time. It was ridiculous how loud it was.\n\nThis place sucks balls...and not the good kind! \n\nThis place just gave reason for a bitch fest that night from my friends, and they are not even Yelpers!

I've heard of Vegas heat, but just couldn't deal with the heat that goes beyond 110 degrees without A/C and searched for the next auto center I could spot (BIG mistake). I came across this auto center that we passed several times on Spring Mountain. The owner came out and asked me in Korean what was wrong and I told him my A/C stopped working. He was very friendly at first and told us to wait inside. I stepped inside to find many out-of-date ads and decors that made me wonder if I was in the 80s Korea. I took out my phone and started yelping the place just to make sure it was decent (how bad could it be?). All I could see in the reviews were \"scammer,\" \"don't go here,\" etc. I look over to my girlfriend with a panic in my expression: \"what have we got ourselves into?\" \n\nAn hour passes by and the owner comes back in the waiting room and says it's done. Wait. What? I'm used to auto centers telling me what is wrong with the car first and giving me an estimate before they perform anything on my car. He comes in and punches numbers and says it's $140--\"a good deal\" in his words. I become very skeptical of the \"receipt\" he gave me that just says \"services\" next to the prices and ask him for what exactly was done. He just mumbles that it's all explained on the bottom of the receipt and almost snatches my debit card and makes the payment. At this point, I'm just furious since there was random sentence that didn't describe what they did repeated three times on the bottom of the page. \n\nAnyways, we go to the car and start the car. 5 seconds pass by, 30 seconds pass by, 1 minute passes by, 2 minutes pass by without cold air coming from the A/C. I go back inside to tell the owner that the A/C is still not working. He calls his mechanic and he works on it for another hour (that includes them running to the Auto Zone next door and getting a thermometer that they didn't have). I just wanted to get out of this scam hole, so as soon as they were \"done fixing\" my car, I drove off. The A/C worked fine until the next day when I had to drive it to another auto shop with a more reputable yelp reviews and they told me the Freon levels were too high and could cause damage in the long run.\n\nLesson learned: Please do yourself a favor and read reviews before you go anywhere!", "business_id": "1BmMabtdhKK9kJ1uUprrCw", "stars": 1, "date": "2015-07-15", "useful": 4, "type": "review", "cool": 1}, {"funny": 4, "user_id": "miskEJJjrNVqeyLS-J7_Vg", "review_id": "ztTfMsoWve2wlgwJKGEQiA", "text": "I stopped by here to get the tire pressure checked in my car and was told to go to the gas station next door and do it myself!

The odds in feeling like you won the Powerball are zilch when you escape to the Hualapai Canyon Trail. Walking on the 0.8 mile Hualapai Canyon Trail takes you to an ethereal place physically and mentally that money can't buy. \n\n    The Hualapai Canyon Park is located in the shadows of the TPC Golf Course on the rolling hills of Summerlin, Las Vegas, Nevada between the mesmerizing Spring Mountains and Las Vegas Strip. The trailhead sits off a relatively new parking lot connected to Hualapai Way between Alta Drive and Town Center Drive. \n\n     Vegas is Sun City. The endless sunshine creates a hormone called serotonin. This boosts a person's mood and encourages a state of being happy, calm, and focused. Add to the sunshine the celestial gardens and open spaces, and the sum is a priceless hour in the park. \n\n      This past Saturday, on one of the first Saturdays of 2016; I visited Hualapai Canyon Park. Because the park is relatively small and I drove across the Valley, I would hike it as a prequel to Peccole Ranch Walking Trail. The neat thing about Hualapai Canyon Park is that it is close by to many of the Summerlin trails including Peccole Ranch, Cottonwood Canyon, and Angel Park Trail. You can make a day out of exploring it with its sister trails. \n\n    In recent times, the City of Las Vegas built a small parking lot at the trailhead. I wanted to mention this because a major flaw when the park opened in 2010 was a scarcity of parking. However, when I visited I parked in back of the professional building at the northeast corner of Hualapai and Alta. From there I walked a relatively short distance along the east side of Hualapai Way to the trailhead. This extended walk gave me a perspective Vista of the landscape that blends in with the TPC land to create a large expanse of open space in the City. \n\n    My first impression was that this is a clean park. The city takes vandalism and graffiti seriously. Near the map of the park, the City has a sign stating to call the Marshalls at 702-229-6444 if you see graffiti. I am glad to report that I saw zilch. \n\n   The layout of the 0.8 mile trail is the shape of a skinny oval that travels west to east in a xeriscape of desert gardens bordered by Hualapai Way to the west, TPC open space to the south and east, and homes to the north. Street lamps are interspersed with compass barrel cacti, teddy bear cholla cacti, Yucca trees, cacti, and desert plants. The landscape blends in with the distant views of the Spring Mountains. If I was unfamiliar with Summerlin, I might think that Mount Charleston was across Hualapai Way. Excluded from the park is a canyon. The park name came into existence from a naming suggestion contest. When you progress along the trail every 1/10 a mile there are concrete animal tracks. Speaking of animals I did catch a jack rabbit and desert mice. There are a sundry of benches to sit and absorb the scenery. My favorite benches were at the easternmost periphery overlooking the TPC land extending toward the Suncoast and Queenridge. In the future I could be looking at a freshly laid out Angel Park Trail extension connecting Hualapai Canyon Park to the tapestry of the Summerlin trail system. I couldn't get too comfortable where I would fall asleep on a bench. All the benches feature a divider. It is my understanding that this is to discourage the homeless. To make the most out of the park, I hiked the trail from both directions. \n\n   Vegas is Sun City. Although it currently doesn't have the Powerball with a chance to become a billionaire; it has sunny places such as the Hualapai Canyon Park Trail that will make you happier than a billionaire when you take in the serotonin of the sun while following a windy white road through an ethereal oasis.", "business_id": "-emIw7Lm6GLgsRNlGz3pog", "stars": 4, "date": "2016-01-14", "useful": 17, "type": "review", "cool": 16}, {"funny": 7, "user_id": "eZfHm0qI8A_HfvXScwIYsg", "review_id": "Bwn4rzJQDIuS1OG1kYRuiQ", "text": "Thanks to Norm K.

Do not touch.\"\n\"DO NOT FEED THE ANIMALS, FUUUCK!\"\n\n...and yet, I saw dozens of infractions by both children and adults alike. Poking the animals and touching things meant to be untouched, reaching into the pens and climbing into cramped spaces. And guess who probably gets in trouble if something 'bad' happens? Yeah.\n\nAnyway - loved this farm. I only saw a few of those clever and very serious looking Nubian goats (the ones that look like this: http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2204/3539010821_48549c46e2.jpg) - the rest must have been hiding. The horses and donkeys looked pretty chill but it was the pigs that were the star of the show.\n\nThey have Tamworth pigs (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tamworth_(pig)) here! There were two adults and over a dozen little ones that entertained me by chasing each other, rolling around in the mud, pouncing on each other and otherwise frolicking. The pigs are soooo cute, and apparently they are pretty hard to find, but love Canada's \"adverse climate\" so they thrive here. I could watch these pigs for hours.\n\nI had to remove a star for two reasons - one being the lack of proper signage around the farm (I inadvertently found myself in the adjacent park twice; the path isn't clearly marked to indicate that you're leaving the farm area) and the pens don't have large enough species indicators. Remember back in the day at the Metro Toronto Zoo where the ground was painted with hooves/paw prints leading you to certain animals? They could benefit from that here. \n\nThe second reason is the cows. \n\nThey looked extremely sad and it was hard to look at them. One of the cows was outside and roaming freely, chewing on something grassy and just generally hanging out. She looked OK, but kind of bored (I dunno, what do cows do?). There were two other cows stuck indoors at Francey Barn and they were in total darkness, tied by the collar with a two foot chain, which was scarcely long enough to allow them to dip their heads into the feeding and water trough. Why are they in here? And why can't they roam freely? Why so dark? It really bummed me out.\n\nCome here year round from 9am-5pm but come early if you don't enjoy the presence of children.

Near the freeway it is a major arterial with consistent shopping centers, restaurants, and businesses. All these businesses add up to traffic. The result is that life on Eastern Avenue is often not life in the fast lane but in the slow lane. When developers over built this part of Eastern Avenue, they spared a 7-acre parcel of land at the southeast corner of Eastern Avenue and Pebble Road from asphalt. It is Pebble Park. \n\n   Driving by Pebble Park often on my commute,  it is hard to believe that there is a peaceful place bordering the stop and go traffic of Eastern Avenue. Yesterday,  I would spend time in this place. I just left work and was sitting in that long red light where eastbound Pebble Road stopped for Eastern Avenue traffic. Sitting at the light, my eyes were looking toward a magnificent sundown over the nearby Black Mountain. One of my dearest activities is spending time in the open spaces surrounding Las Vegas. Unfortunately I can't get out there the series of days that I work. The sun coming down over Black Mountain is a connection to the open spaces that I cherish. When the long light finally changed to green, I proceeded to the first right which is Topaz Street toward the tiny parking lot.\n\n    The complaint I have about Pebble Park is that the parking lot only holds three vehicles. The majority of the parking is along Topaz Drive.\n\n   Pebble Park is rectangular shaped park between Pebble Road and the I-215 soundwall. When you walk into the park, you see a walkway toward a playground. This is a neat playground with tall flower sculpture things. The walkway crosses the Pitman Wash where it divides into an oval walkway through open space of grass bordered by Moon Nursery and Pebble Road up to Eastern Avenue. The walkway includes sufficient lighting. The few people that I saw were spending quality time with their dogs. There have been complaints over people failing to pick up after their dogs. I'll take this nuisance over graffiti. Pebble Park seems to be relatively graffiti free. When a park is graffiti free, it gives me the impression that the criminal shadow is not following me. Another thing that creates an impression that crime is not a major concern is that Moon Nursery has trees for sale alongside the oval trail. If crime is an issue, people would walk into the park to steel these nursery trees. \n\n    The highlight of the park is the uninterrupted view of Black Mountain. Although Black Mountain is a few miles distant, this view gives it the illusion that it is close by. This is a spectacular location to take in the sundown and sunrise over Black Mountain. The pictures below are Yelp postcards of the sundown and sunrise over Black Mountain seen from Pebble Park. \n\n    Pebble Park is a good Park that could be great. It's greatest challenge is connectivity. It is the westernmost point of the Pitman Wash Trail,  the multiuse path that winds through Green Valley toward Cornerstone Park. Continuing onto the Pitman Wash Trail requires crossing four lanes of traffic on Pebble Road. I would like to see Pitman Wash Trail rerouted into the wash through a tunnel beneath Pebble Road that would connect to Pebble Park. Better yet, Pebble Park could be a hub connecting to Cactus Wren Park and the Beltway Bike Trail. If you drew a line directly south across Interstate 215,  you would connect to the Cactus Wren Trail and perpendicular Beltway Bike Trail. The Pitman Wash tunnels under Interstate 215 could be expanded to accommodate people. This would improve the quality of life by expanding recreation opportunities and keeping bicyclists and pedestrians away from the major traffic of Eastern in the vicinity of Interstate 215. \n\n   Sometimes in life it's the little things that are a big deal. On the long days when I work,  it is a little thing such as the sun coming down over a mountain that is a big thing. After hours of negatively, watching the sun come down made my day. The thing I really like about Pebble Park is that it creates the illusion that Black Mountain is close up.

Even worse, the hummus was quite bland and suspiciously bitter. Like...how do you mess up something this simple? I think the most horrifying part was that for what had to be at least a half pound of hummus, there was one tiny little serving of pita bread. Like, take a little 5\" circle of it that you would buy from the store, heat it up, and then cut it in half. That's how much you get. Seriously, WTF man? I would have paid extra for at least a full serving of bread.\n\nThe gyro is arguably the worst I've had. It's on par with college cafeterias and places that totally don't specialize in them.

Here's how it went.\n\nCoworker: My sister's 30 birthday is coming up and we don't know what to get her. Any ideas?\n\nMe: As a matter of fact, I have a friend with a 30th bday soon and here's what I planned. It's sort of a \"welcome to your 30s\" tool kit, complete with khaki Capri pants, a belt clip for your cell phone, a pair of crocs and maybe a gift cert for a sensible hair cut that says \"I don't need keep up with fashion because I'm 30 now and above all that.\"\n\nCoworker: Um...yeah.\n\nTo dissuade me from my hilarious present, she then sent me a link to Studio Vino, where you can custom label any of the bottles of wine for special occasions such as birthdays, anniversaries, babies, weddings - whatever. So, you send them a picture of your parents, your sister, etc., come up with a name for your wine and maybe a tagline (I imagine \"Just Keeps Getting Better With Age\" is pretty popular). Then the owner designs a label using colors you request or she'll do it all on her own. All (including the wine) for like $15! Wow, what a unique gift with a quick turnaround (in my case 24 hours) for less than $20\n\nI made one for my mom for her bday. Since her dog is pretty special to her, I put his picture on the bottle, called the wine \"Hair of the Dog\" and made it \"Draco's Special Reserve.\" Kari, the owner and the one who designs your labels, came up with a color scheme that complemented the image, and even made the \"o\" in \"Draco\" a paw print. Cu-u-u-te. Mom LOVED it and the gift was the hit of the party. Here's how it went down: I sent Kari my desired image and text via email Saturday at about 2p. She sent me three versions within an hour. I picked one and asked her to tweak the colors, she sent me the new version. I OK'd it and had the bottle in hand by 1p the next day.\n\nThat being said, custom labeling is not the crux of this business, but is merely a convenient off-shoot of her very cool enterprise. At Studio Vino, you pay about $350 to make and bottle your very own case of wine. So, you choose a grape, spices, flowers, roots - whatever, mix it up, she barrels it at her studio for 75 days (or the allotted time). Then you come back in with up to six of your friends and have a bottling and label-making party - complete with food and music of your choice. You can do a half case for a little less, I believe.\n\n\nPretty great, huh?

Fusion Rolls, cornbread, mac n cheese, polish boy, and a BBQ chicken wrap.\n\nThey didn't have soda or any other drink except water.

Oh yeah, because they were DELICIOUS!!! I mean, out of this world good. Never had anything like it and would recommend them to any and everybody. They look like big fried egg rolls with chicken, collard greens, black beans, corn, bell peppers, and Asiago cheese in them. My husband doesn't even like beans or greens and he LOVED these. And the sauce. THE sauce. THE SAUCE THOUGH!? As Uncle Jessie would say, \"Have Mercy!\" \n\nTo me, the Fusion Rolls were the highlight. Everything else was pretty good. The polish boy was more of a bit of coleslaw with fries and A LOT of BBQ dumped on top. Wasn't a total fan of the ensemble but it was still good. The mac n cheese... WHY LORD MUST I STILL BE ON MY SEARCH!? I've been searching for the A+ bomb diggity (ew, why did I just write that? the 90's are calling) mac n cheese and I have YET to find it. The mac n cheese, once again, needed some stank on it. Season it up, use more cheese, use different cheeses, something! Come on Cleveland! Someone has to make really good mac n cheese and I WILL find them.\n\nAnyway, the cornbread looked really cool (looked like pancakes) and they had green peppers and corn in it. It was pretty good even though I was expecting it to be a bit sweet, which it wasn't. At all. No biggie but I prefer my cornbread slightly sweet. My husband's wrap was pretty good as well with A LOT of sauce. So much, he had to use his fries to sop up the excess BBQ sauce.

Ok 10 min later he calls and says he can't find it on his GPS, even though I spelled the street out and this house had been here for over 50 years, ok I try to explain more in depth and he says ok. 15 minutes go by, still not here.

He starts examining my door (last guy I had popped it open in 5 seconds, no exam needed. (twss?)) He asks how much it has cost in the past. $50 average I say ($50 twice, $60, and $45) He was like, \"wow, really are you sure?\" Um yeah I am a professional outer-locker(?). I'm thinking ok he probably thinks that is high and will give me a good deal (The WEBSITE ADVERTISES $29 LOCK OUT SERVICE). He takes my Driver license and starts writing down my info. Then he drops the big one, \"Yeah were a little more expensive than other places, it's going to be $125.\"!!!!!! I immediately blurt out \"yeah, there is no way in hell, I don't think so\". He says, \"So you don't want me to open the door?\" \"No thanks, that is overpriced\". He says, 'Well I am still going to have to charge you a $35 service fee\".

Yes, both sandwiches that were ordered had no melted cheese, but were just a little warmed up.  And there was so little of it.  The quality of the bread (they only offer basic white and wheat) is also pretty flimsy.

At least take the time to make your own mac and cheese from scratch.\n\nAnd the soups - they were out of lobster bisque but I question their ability to make a quality soup after tasting the tomato soup.  It was worse than a canned campbell's soup.  It was like they bought it bulk from the Cash and Carry/Smart and Final store and served it up.  And the bread bowls they served it in were cold and there was no incentive to eat the bread after attempting to finish the soup.

But my review is based mostly on poor communication and a lack of professionalism.\n\nStephanie was recommended to me for newborn photos by a friend. I asked my friend if Stephanie did maternity as well and she didn't know but gave me Stephanie's number to inquire. I didn't hear back from Stephanie right away, but when we spoke she gave me a long explanation about why she doesn't like to do maternity shoots, mostly having to do with the fact that she thinks pregnant women are difficult. She said that, since a good client referred me, she could do me a favor and do the shoot. I appreciated her making an exception for me. \n\nIt was difficult to communicate with her in regards to the session. I had questions about wardrobe and concerns regarding the weather. Her replies seemed curt and I almost felt like a nuisance. \n\nMany of the photos themselves looked like they came from a novice, at best. I had shown Stephanie a must-have photo from Pinterest, and an engagement photo, that I wanted to replicate and we didn't even come close. When I told her about them she responded with a bit of a negative, \"no can do\" attitude. I gave no impression that I wanted these to be an \"exact\" replication but her responses centered around the fact that all photographers have different styles and, between lighting and other conditions, it would be impossible to replicate. She also asked why I wasn't just using my engagement photographer if I had liked her so much (because she's back east). \n\nThe session itself was kind of a mess. The forecast called for high winds. I had brought up my concerns 5 days prior to the shoot, but she didn't respond. My hair was in my face for a few shots that would have otherwise been my favorite. My husband was squinting in a few of his shots because the sun was directly in his eyes. Stephanie and her assistant (her husband) have a strange working relationship where they appear to talk passive aggressively to each other and it was uncomfortable for us as clients.They bickered about camera settings, aperture, lighting and positioning, etc. Honestly, it seemed like a bit of a circus.\n\nIt is my understanding that a good photographer can shoot anything even under challenging circumstances. But Stephanie didn't make reference to the fact that her skill level was lacking in the way of maternity sessions until well after the session, just that she didn't like to do them. If she had told me that she really didn't feel comfortable shooting maternity photos, I would have been very receptive to and appreciative of that response and would have went elsewhere.\n\nI always give credit where credit is due, and there are some great things about Lullaby Lane. The price is unbeatable, and she is patient and gentle with newborns. Most of our newborn photos were excellent. My only complaints about the newborn shoot were, again, the strange working relationship between her and her husband, and the fact that many of our shots were with my son in the same blue basket as a prop, despite my requests to change up the basket. So even without the maternity shoot issues, we wouldn't go back.      \n\nWhen Stephanie emailed me recently requesting a Yelp review, I thought it was only fair to share with her where we thought her customer service and communication were lacking. Instead of taking the opportunity to apologize, or even learn from what could have been used as constructive criticism, she responded with an extremely unprofessional and emotional email, full of rationalizations, excuses, and blame towards me. \n\nShe made remarks such as, \"I am stupid\", \"I should have stuck to my guns\", \"You wouldn't take no for an answer\", etc. She basically acted as though I put a gun to her head to do the maternity shoot. She offered; I accepted. And I expected to be afforded the same time and service as any other client once she accepted the job. She rationalized being difficult to communicate with about the maternity session because she \"doesn't usually do maternity.\" That doesn't give you a pass to skimp on professionalism and respect. She used excuses such as, \"You were too far pregnant,\" for the shoot being uncomfortable and not being able to reschedule. But I was about 33 to 34 weeks, followed by a perinatologist, and in no imminent danger of going into preterm labor. \n\nI do think she lacks people skills, and that's probably why it serves her best to stick with photographing babies. But even when she does, she has a strange way about her that made my husband and I feel uncomfortable. \n\nI think Lullaby Lane offers decent newborn photos at a very reasonable price but, in my experience, bargain photography isn't the way to go.

As I pulled up, you cant help but notice the Mr Wings signage and my greatest weakness is to always find out if a wing joint is any good.\n\nAs I come in, this place kind of reminds me of Hamburger Hut off of Cheyenne just east of the I-15 in North Las Vegas. They share the same space as the mini mart. This location doesn't have any tables. Just chairs so you can wait for your order and take it to go.\n\nI ended up ordering the 6 piece wings combo ($7.99). Comes with a half a pound of House Fries and soda. You can add a more wings for a dollar each. You have the option of flavoring your fries too for no extra charge. Flavors like garlic, garlic parmesan, lemon pepper, cajun, Jamaican jerk, salt n vinegar, seal salt and cracked pepper, Mr Bbq rub, southwest chipotle, and devil's rub. \n\nI got the spicy barbeque flavor for my wings. The sauce was really good. It had a little sweetness to it followed by a decent kick of spice but not too much to the point you cant enjoy your food. The wings were a decent size and was cooked properly. I think next time I will request it extra crispy because that's how I prefer my wings on a normal basis. I just forgot to request it is all. For the fries I chose the garlic parmesan flavoring. I noticed the fries were battered. Not sure if this is normal when you select a flavoring or if thats just the way the fries are. Anyways, the way it was flavored was really good. Dip it in the ranch sauce they give you and you're set. \n\nThe only things that may have annoyed me besides the fact that everything has to be to go is that I originally wanted one of the fusion sauces (chipotle bbq which was bbq and southwest chipotle) for my wings. The lady informed me that it was two sauces so i couldnt order it. I mean honestly, how hard is to put two sauces together to form one? Technically that is one sauce when you mix it up. Lady still said no so whatever. Also after you order, they hand you the ticket order and have to go to the mini mart part to pay for it at the front counter.\n\nOverall I am intrigued by this place. Cant wait to try all the sauces not to mention the different flavors you can get for your house fries. They also have sandwiches, wraps, chicken strips, and regular fried chicken.

Here's what went wrong:\n\nThe event is from 6-8 so we arrived just a few minutes (3 maybe?) after 6 so we could get a spot just in case it was hoppin'.  We walked in and the hostess (she looks like she's possibly the manager or owner) asked if we were there for the event and then pointed us towards the back room where the event was being held.\n\nWe walked in and there were about 7 tables and there were people at them all already.  Talk about early bird gets the worm!  We had to wait for about 3-4 minutes for the waitress to finish with a table to find out if we could sit on the patio for the event.  She said yes and that she would be right out to help us.  In the meantime another woman and her friend also took up at a patio table nearby.\n\n20 minutes later the hostess/owner/manager looking woman came out and asked if we had been helped yet.  We said no and she left only to return with a small happy hour flier menu which she just handed from a distance and didn't even come over to our table.  I know you're wondering why I would wait the 15 minutes, but I really wanted to see just how bad the service was going to be and frankly, I just wanted some good $2 wine.\n\nIt's been about 5 minutes and the same woman comes back with full, detailed menus and I asked if the happy hour flier was the deals for the event and she said yes and then asked if we were ready to order.  Um, you just gave us the menus 10 seconds ago...\n\nBy now I'm ready to just order and enjoy the meal deals from the event.  I look over the happy hour flier and I see some app deals.  They said there was a specialty appetizer menu.  Not so much, but whatever.  I can deal with that.  Then I see the drink section.  The claim for the event was $2 glasses of wine.  I was excited to try some nice new wines on the cheap, but again... not so much.  In reality it was $4 glasses of house wine which only consisted of three different wines that weren't really what I was looking for.  By now, the other women that were outside decided to leave having had enough of this shenanigans.  We decided (after 30 minutes since we arrived) to go next door to Sprouts, get some apps, and have our own \"Wine Down Wednesday\" at home.\n\nI bet there are plenty of people that will have good experiences here and continue to visit happily, but this one experience has caused me to write them off for good (which I don't usually do after one instance).  I wish that I could actually review their wine and food, but the service was so poor and substandard that it's not worth giving them my money.  I understand if the food isn't good at a restaurant - some are just better or more talented than others.  However, any business can and should have good customer service.  I think this is where the cliched line of \"if I could give them less than 1 star I would\" comes in...\n\nOh yeah, and I slapped down a \"You've been Yelped\" card as I left.\n\nTake that Tastings!!", "business_id": "E0lP3PXXNae84q_z9MtDMw", "stars": 1, "date": "2008-04-17", "useful": 7, "type": "review", "cool": 6}, {"funny": 3, "user_id": "iJCtRAlSvxiUuKlVAnsq0A", "review_id": "51oQrbu7zmKaZTtrdeNshw", "text": "I attended a wedding at the Manor, realizing later that I had my prom there as well.

She finds me does some stuff on the computer and says someone has to bring it up front.  Ok, I said then I will run my hose crank out to my car and move my car to the front of the building, assuming by the time I would return it would be waiting for me and it maybe big so easier to load.  I go and do just that.  At least 10 minutes had passed since I was told someone would bring my order up.  I return to the desk and continue my wait.  Nothing.  No one is coming.  There are employees all around but no one is bringing my order up.  I am getting beyond impatient.  My wait now since coming back in was 15 minutes.  Add the 10 from before and we are pushing almost 30 minutes!  WTF tell me where it is, I will get the thing!  I am eyeballing everyone and looking at my watch.  One employee finally says, \"You still waiting for your order?\"  No I just really like hanging out at service desks looking irritated.  I said, \"yes and I have been waiting over 15 minutes, since I went out to pull my car around. \"  He asks the lady who Lord knows what she says and heads back.  About another 5 minutes passes, but I can see in the home depot horizon the man carrying what appears to be my order!  He approaches and shows me the box to confirm.  My only expression was \"well hallelujah\".   He asked if I wanted to open it, I said no not really I think I spent enough time here.  Well I still needed to sign it out!  Back in line to speak with the lady who originally called someone to bring up my order, yea right, and wait again.  Finally up front she says the system is slow and it's processing.  No I think everything here is slow.  So she jumps to the next person in line and starts ringing them up while I wait again.  Finally the paper prints, I sign and book it out of there with much frustration.  \n\nSo I like my storage box.

A few years ago I was moving and couldn't sell my house.  I decided to rent it out.  Since I was moving across town, I knew it wouldn't be feasible for me to take care of it myself as I wasn't going to drive across town for those (my toilet is overflowing) phone calls.  Based on a friends referral, I decided to hire Gary.  I was concerned about what tenants were selected but, Gary made the process very easy and in no time, he had my place rented out for more than I thought I could get (the \"extra\" every month covers Gary's fee).\n\nGary is very mellow and easy going.  This means he is fabulous at dealing with me and the tenants!!!  Don't let his easy going manner make you think that he doesn't have a sense of urgency or won't follow through.  In the years that I have been dealing with him, he ALWAYS follows through.  You can trust him completely.  He is not one of those agents that you need to babysit.

Located at 1180 de Maisonneuve Ouest, (if you take public transit, it's a convenient two second walk from Peel Metro),  they offer amazing Pizza, a beautiful ambiance and on top of that, you get great service and food for an amazing price.\n\nWe were greeted by their very polite and welcoming staff and got to choose which table we wanted to sit at.  It was hard to decide because the entire area is so beautiful.  I have never been to Italy (yet) but I felt like I was transported to Naples while dining and that hasn't happened in a very long time.  I chose a table that gave me a good view of the entire restaurant while being able to watch the pizzas being prepared.  They use a wood burning oven and that alone made me fall in love right away.\n\nWe started looking at their menu while enjoying water and a good Newcastle Brown  Ale.  Piazza Del Sogno now has their liquor license so if you have ever passed by it before, wishing you could enjoy food with a nice beer or wine, you now can!\n\nFor our Appetizer, we had the Fried Calamari and it will now be the only place I order it.  Other restaurants tend to either make their Calamari too rubbery or their marinara dipping sauce is too bland or too acidic.  Not here.  Their marinara is the perfect compliment for the perfectly done Calamari.\n\nWe then had the Seafood Salad Entr\u00e9e which is a wide variety of fish- squid, mussels, clams, shrimp, with arugula and cherry tomatoes.  The plating was gorgeous and it is incredibly refreshing.  It it the perfect thing to pair with one of their pizzas, which is a \"must try\" for anyone who dines here.  It was absolutely delicious.\n\nI ordered the 'Zucchetta' Pizza- Butternut Squash, caramelized onions, veal sausage topped with smoked cheese and basil leaves.  They had unfortunately run out of the veal sausage, but they were very apologetic and were quick to offer me any other topping to replace it; I chose Chorizo.  I will take this time to point out how nice our server was.  He made the whole experience a fun and memorable one.  \n\nNow, back to the pizza.  I am a huge fan of thin crust pizzas, and this was great because while the crust was still thick around the pizza, it was thin for the area under the toppings- it was the best of both worlds.  They also have a hot sauce that you can put on top if you want a bit of added heat.  The mixture of that, the butternut squash, the amount of delicious cheese- it was all just amazing.  We were pretty full by that point, so we were unable to eat the entire pizza but they wrapped it up for us to take home in two moments.\n\nJohn finished his dining experience with their Espresso which is gaining in popularity.  He enjoyed it and said he wished he could have had a full sized coffee mug full of it.\n\nOverall, I will definitely be going back and if anyone ever asks for a recommendation for pizza, I know I will be telling them that they have to go to Piazza Del Sogno.  For a restaurant that opened only a few months ago, (and dealt with minor setbacks like any restaurant would when it first opens), the future is looking bright and I give them 5/5 Stars.  I can't wait to go back, especially since I was too full to try any of the desserts we saw when we entered.

The girl came on the speaker and I told her I would like a dozen, and she said \"An Express Dozen\", I said, no I would like to choose them, and she said I couldn't do that at the drive thru window.

For a non-fried, lower fat option try the Idy - the CIAH version is 6 little pressed and steamed puffs of lentil/rice flour served with a couple of awesome chutneys.  The roti are all quite decent and represent a value relative to other similar establishments in the hood.  Of special note: The coconut chutney.  Lately, I've noticed a sad trend that a lot of places have begun to phone-in their traditional condiments / accompaniments; canned, bottled and jarred versions of the classics.  All of the condiments that I had at CIAH were house made and mighty fine.

The music in the smaller electronica room is much better and is more likely to instill that \"OMG, I this mix is awesome, I want it!\" emotion we have all experienced going to a great nightclub.  Unfortunately, like the main room, the music is too loud to enjoy here as well and ears are ringing after just a few moments.\n\nDRINKS: Drinks range from weak to mediocre.

I felt waterlogged before I could feel the slightest buzz.\n\nBOTTOM LINE: My friends and I REALLY want to like this bar (that's why we've gone back 4 more times) but it just can't compare to how good the late Boom and the late Crowbar (now DWNTWN) were.", "business_id": "3eJHF_6OdjjVy-84oKrt7Q", "stars": 2, "date": "2008-05-13", "useful": 3, "type": "review", "cool": 4}, {"funny": 3, "user_id": "Yej5B4nd8PqpHMQcmCTDrg", "review_id": "acUVSON-4Ctovl8wAUBJvg", "text": "I don't know how the gays do it.

It opened recently and the word has not gotten out.  The most people I have ever seen inside Lunar Golf at once is seven people - four in my party, two other customers, and the guy that worked there.  So I'm hoping I can talk you into giving it a try, because it's not sustainable with this level of interest.  Otherwise, it'll close its doors and become yet another shuttered storefront inside struggling Metrocenter Mall.\n\nWhy it's better than nearby Castles 'n' Coasters (CnC) :\n\n- AIR CONDITIONING.\n- Eight bucks per person (same price) BUT each person gets to play up to three rounds.  So if you have some time to burn, you can play a lot of mini golf.  Might I recommend at least one round of \"speed mini golf\"?  Play one hole at a time with the winner determined by who putted out the fastest according to a stopwatch (no hitting the ball again until it's stopped).  You have to move and putt quickly without rushing your shots.  We did that for our second round and had a blast.\n- Sweet, sweet air conditioning.\n- A \"prize hole\" once you're done golfing where you can win three free rounds for next time (one person in our party did).\n- You don't feel like you're sweating nonstop.\n- Much less crowded ;)\n- It's not over 100 degrees.\n- Blacklights! (if you're into blacklights and seeing people's teeth look funny)\n\nWhat's not quite as good:\n\n- Two courses (as opposed to four, but this is still two more AIR-CONDITIONED courses than CnC).  \n- The decor is all mostly the same - lots of glow paint that looks neat under the blacklights, but CnC has a little more variety.\n- It seems \"foggy\" inside for some reason, you'll think you're developing glaucoma but I think this is just the blacklight effect.  I recommend occasionally looking out at the storefront (and into the brightly lit mall) to reassure yourself that you're not slowly going blind.\n- Parts of the carpet (not on the course) are coming up and you can't see well enough to avoid a little tripping.  But that adds to the adventure, right?\n- All of the golf balls are the same color (because they're glow-in-the-dark golf balls).  EDIT: Turns out this was just a lazy worker one night.  They have different-colored golf balls - if you get all the same color, demand golf ball diversity!\n\nThe pros definitely outweigh the cons (looks like 8-4 - and if you think I'm cheating by counting air conditioning four times, you have NEVER lived through a Phoenix summer).

This was the second time I took her here, and it'll be the last! Guess Tapino just isn't for her. Out of the three small plates we shared, she only enjoyed the lamb kabob over quinoa ($9). It was the second-best dish of the three I enjoyed.\n\nI'd wanted to try a glass of rose ($7), since Mom is a fan, but she was \"too tired\" to have wine, so I'll have to bookmark that for next visit. We started w/ the butternut squash ravioli w/ sage butter ($8; mmm... I adore brown butter and sage... My Mom, however, doesn't). I appreciated the sweet creaminess of the squash puree against the slight toothiness of the ravioli. The sage butter added just enough salt to the dish, while the toasted candied pecan bits on top added impeccable crunch! How I wished I had all three pieces! (She ate one and didn't even enjoy it! How infuriating! LOL)The second dish we tried was the baked escargots w/ butter, parsley, lemon, and puff pastry ($7). Compared to the multi-faceted ravioli dish, this was a bit disappointing. While I enjoyed the textures that the snails and crunchy puff pastry offered (TOO crunchy, if you ask me! Those babies were bordering on hard! Where's the \"puff?,\" I ask.), the butter and parsley treatment fell flat. Mom again only had one. I believe there were 6 total. Don't misunderstand- I still ate all the rest... I was hungry!! :D\n\nLast, but not the least, came the skewer of lamb kabob (3 pcs; $9) w/ bell peppers and onions, served over cold saffron quinoa w/ cucumber sauce (served on the side).  Thankfully, the lamb pieces were savory enough not to have needed the sauce. Loved the quinoa.\n\nCheck out the photos I took...

Ever since I joined Yelp, and especially since I moved to Beechview, I'd been very interested in visiting Davio, but their exorbitant dinner prices kept me at bay. Davio's Sunday breakfast, along with their menu overall, is a fascinating read. Hyperbole abounds, long Italian phrases and wordy descriptions are abundant (Hey stop it! At least I don't speak Italian. Be glad I speak no French! My anti-literate haters would really be steamed!). However, unlike their criminally expensive dinner menu, their breakfast bill of fare (it's only done on Sundays, and for some reason, the breakfast is CASH ONLY) is charitably reasonable. Our two meals combined came in at around $28, which is much less than the majority of their single dinner entrees.\n\nThe decor is as quirky as a spinster's apartment. Large, odd-looking, aged ceiling fans and other such fixtures hung imperiously over our heads. If they were animate, they would not give a damn what we or anyone else thought of them. \n\nUnfortunately, none of the staff seemed to care about what I might have thought of the much anticipated Eggs Poached In Tomato Sauce With Bacon and Polenta. The bland eggs were cooked hard and had no runny yolk inside, the bacon was akin to the synthetic, freebie strain offered by chain motels in the morning: think of savory, fatty plastic. A pungent, rustic, chunky tomato sauce almost saved the dish, burying all of its negative traits, almost. \n\n\"Something tastes burnt,\" I mentioned to Kay. \n\nAh, it was the polenta. Mystery solved. Hoo. Ray.\n\nSfinci Di San Giuseppi, called something else on the menu and offered by many Italian restaurants and pizza parlors under numerous names, was the lone highlight of our bleak brunch. Weighty pieces of fried dough were dusted with powdered sugar and served with an array of jams, some of which tasted to have been made in-house. Scone-like in their appearance and composition, the zeppoli (???) were chewy and dense like pretzels yet possessed a saccharine flavor  reminiscent of donuts. \n\nAwkwardly enough, our waitress brought them out in a basket covered with a cloth napkin after a lengthy wait, put one on each of our plates, covered them back up, and placed them way on the other side of the tablem making them difficult to reach without standing. \n\nAwkwardly still, she left us our check before our meal was finished without a total and then ignored us for the remainder of our visit. Thankfully, I have a calculator application on my cell phone and was able to determine a sum. We left our cash on the table and quietly left while we watched our server dote on Davio's stuffy, monied, middle-aged regulars. Methinks they ain't neighborhood folk based on the decadent, strident, rub-our-noses-in-shit conversations that were impossible not to overhear. \n\nAlso strange were the assortment of supposedly fresh-baked pastries that were arranged on plates on a table in front of us. We were never told they were complimentary and didn't find out until one of the battleaxes I speak of went and helped herself to them right before we departed. They sure looked delectable, but we got the sense that we weren't wanted ('you should have made a reservation') and had since lost our appetites due to the unfulfilling main courses and choppy service. Eager to escape we were. \n\nWe could see the \"clown\" painting from their webpage on the wall catacorner from us the entire time we dined. He looked sad and apologetic, as if he saw us coming, knowing that we'd be left chapfallen by our experience. \n\nP.S. I had a taste of Kay's Farmer's Wife Frittata and only tasted the canned asparagus. Goat cheese was also present, but you'd never know if you were blindfolded. \n\nP.P.S. Being a class-conscious person of modest means in a modest neighborhood, I resent Davio charging so much for dinner.

I had such a nice stay at the La Quinta Inn. I got a room with a microwave and fridge so that it would be easy for me to prepare food. The fridge was a great size! I was impressed. And the TVs have easy hook up so it was very simple to plug in my Xbox360 so I could watch Netflix and play video games. The hotel was very clean and always had a light citrus scent. The staff was friendly and helpful. The continental breakfast was amazing and really helped to save money because all week I had breakfast there. I was able to save so much money on food while in Cleveland because I had my breakfast at the hotel and went to the local Super Walmart to pick up groceries so I wouldn't need to get take out for ever meal. Oh ya, and because I was staying for a full week they had a special deal that was really cheap! I could not believe the price for two beds and a room with a refrigerator and microwave. Also the other awesome thing was the size of the room. My two friends were there to take care of me after surgery and we all stayed very comfortably in the large room together with two double beds. Also, I spent a lot of time in that bed because of healing for surgery. I spent almost the whole week in bed and that bed was so comfortable!\nThe AC worked wonderfully and we were always nice and comfortable. The place was quiet. I got so much rest. The sheets and bedding and pillows all seemed brand new. Honestly, staying in this hotel was the next best thing to staying at home. I am unbelievably satisfied. I honestly don't have a single thing to complain about. I wish I could rate it higher than a 5.\nAlso things people might appreciate, it is right near the Airport and they shuttle you if you need them to. And it's literally across the street from the train station. But don't worry about train noise. You can see the trains from your room windows but you can't hear them at all.

First off, let me back track and say this is AMAZING that Pittsburgh has a bike rental service. We now have wide open bike lanes, a bike friendly community and people ready to hop on there and ride. Me being on of them. But hop on and ride I did not...\n\nI had friends in from out of town and thought this would be the perfect opportunity to try this out for the first time. Probably in hindsight I should have done my research, but how hard could bike rental be? Very hard it turns out. I tried earlier to bring up their website and figure out how to tackle the steps needed before going. I was very confused with their website in terms of how to sign up. Plus, I thought it was weird there was no prompted for an app. When I googled an app, I couldn't find one either, so I figured there was none. I finally signed up for what was the first step. I tried to enter my credit card for the second step and it kept denying it. \n\nWe went to the kiosk on 10th and Penn and there was a kiosk, so I thought good, I can just do the transaction there. After typing in my phone number a couple times and then the pin I got in the email, the VERY sensitive key bad literally blacked out. Broken. Well... we finally got someone's card to work on their website and got the bikes out... after a half an hour of sorting out the rental process. \n\nWe gloriously rode down the Penn Ave bike lane. Wind in our hair, bell ringing and waving to happy people passing us by. It was awesome. We went to the Strip and locked our bikes up outside of Bella Notte and sat down for a bite. After some delicious pizza we were ready to roll again. After typing in 3 of the 4 pins we needed for our bikes, the last bike wouldn't unlock. Well, that's odd. We tried everything... they give you two pins, which is confusing in itself. We'd type in the two pins and then the screen would black out. \n\nSo we called costumer service and proceeded to be put on hold for over a half hour. We finally go through to India, because that's were the call center apparently is. We find out that there's a city wide issue and all the bikes are broken. Great. So we somehow convinced the dude to refund us for that bike. We literally had to leave the bike there, sadly. \n\nSo we biked down a couple blocks to the 21st and Smallman station and locked the 3 bikes up. We ended up seeing another sad looking couple who was also sitting on hold for the same problem. What a crappy situation. Thankfully, we were refunded for all 4 bikes, which was awesome, but still it kinda ruined our plans for the day. \n\nAgain, I'm SO excited that we have something like this in Pittsburgh, although I wish they would have gone with an American company instead of what I believe is a German manufacturer. And how about having an American call center as well... or better yet, a local one? How about one step further and have people out on the streets covering some ground when there's issues. \n\nSome might say I'm crazy, but I'll give it another try. But I'll be wary. \n\nIMPORTANT INFO: they do have an app called NextBike, so download it. I know, the name doesn't match up, but I think it's the company that runs them.

While it may be the safest way to get through this neighborhood at present, I particularly dislike the narrow blind corners, so on my way up to the trail, I often avoid them by climbing the hill and crossing the RR tracks (which you're not supposed to do, but I'm a railfan, so I know about trains and I'm careful). Speaking of which, closer to the Oakland side, this trail connects to the other Schenley Park trails via a connector that crosses the RR tracks.  While not nearly as busy as many other RR tracks in PGH, these tracks (the same ones I cross) see a few trains a day, so take appropriate caution when crossing them.\n\nI've heard that wild turkeys live along this trail, but I've never actually seen them--at least, not in the park.

Pretty risky, considering I could very easily get a trouser-tickling burgasm at Sonny's instead, but seeing as how the price of burger was the same in both locations, I thought I'd steel-cage-match this bitch, and see which burger came out on top.

Thank you Charlie's for making my house presentable!\n\nI needed a new house cleaning service recently, so of course I used handy dandy Yelp to see what house cleaning services were making people happy right now.  I tried calling the first company that was listed and I couldn't get anyone to answer the phone or call me back after leaving voicemails.  After a couple of tries, I moved on to the #2 company, Charlie's Maids.  And I am so very happy that I did!\n\nFirst off, my phone call was answered right away by the owner, Agnes.  She was super friendly and helpful.  She was out of the office at the time and asked me to send her some info about my house.  She said she would get back to me when she could get to the office and she totally DID.  I thought I was going to have to wait until the next weekday at the earliest (I had called on a Saturday), but Agnes got back to me in about an hour.  Nice!\n\nThe day of my first service was simply wonderful as well.  I hadn't had my house cleaned in a while, so it was in massive need of some help.  The secret is out, I am a disaster when it comes to housekeeping! Shhhh, don't tell anyone!  Anyway, my first service was going to be a deep clean to get everything back in order.  I have done this in the past, and most companies charge a flat fee for a certain amount of time and then an extra fee for addition time needed after the initial amount.  Charlie's does it with a flat fee and they work until it is done, even if it takes all day.  I think they spent over 3 hours making my house sparkle! I paid $169 for the deep clean for a 3 bedroom, 2.5 bath, 2 story house.  This is a great price, in my opinion, especially considering the quality of the services rendered.  There were no hidden up-charges along the way or any hidden fees for anything.  Nice!\n\nI liked how the deep clean service went as well.  On the first visit, Irene met me ready to go and jumped right into it.  She did a walk through of my embarrassingly messy house along side me.  She explained what was included in the service I purchased.  She told me everything that would be in in each room, and if there were other options that would cost more, if I was interested.  It was nice to know what to expect.  She also asked me in each room if there was something special I wanted done.  Nice!\n\nAt the end of the cleaning, Irene did a walk through with me again to make sure I was happy with everything they had done.  She said if I was ever not happy with something, just let her know and they would work at it until I was pleased.  Great customer service all the way around.  Nice!\n\nI have had a couple biweekly cleanings since my first cleaning with Charlie's and have been very happy with each one.   At the beginning of each one, Irene asks me if I need anything special done in any of the rooms.  She is always super pleasant and delightful.  She always makes sure I am happy at the end as well.  I so love good customer service! \n\nThe staff is super friendly as well.  I have had other companies who send out the most unfriendly people ever or people who seemed annoyed by having to come to my house.  Irene and her team of 2 others were so friendly and fun.  They all seemed like good people and were so easy to talk too.  I have a very friendly toddler who decided to make friends with the ladies that came out, though she wasn't so sure about the man that was there.  Every other minute, my kiddo would escape from me and run over to help the ladies with the cleaning.  They were nice to her and even showed her how different things worked, like the vacuum.  My kiddo had a blast and wanted to play with them instead of with me.  The ladies were very nice to her and didn't get mad at her at all.  Nice!\n\nThe prices are all very reasonable for the quality of service you get.  The deep clean was $169 for my average sized house.  I have been getting biweekly service since then and I pay $189 for that.  It is a bit more than I have paid in the past, but the customer service and quality totally make the difference worthwhile.\n\nSo after several great cleanings, I am very, very happy with Charlie's Maids.

Calmly, non-judgmentally, and with an eagerness to help, they listened to us explain our embarrassing situation in embarrassing detail.

Keeping the \"panic\" button pressed as he held it out the window, after just a few minutes of cruising, we came upon the Kaymobile on Maryland Street.

Really? you're going to be that rude and call me out? The dollar amount wasn't important to me. The fact that I had to waste my time going down there to find out they wouldn't honor it and then be treated rudely was the issue. So instead of honoring the coupon and possibly gaining a pair of regular customers for the duration that their business is open, which, if their hospitality is any gauge...won't be long, she decides to be rude and run us off.  GREAT business practice lady!!!  I give you couple more months just like every other business that goes into that location. Now off to Twitter and Facebook to spread the word about this wonderfully rude establishment. Oh, and they got 1 star because I couldn't give less.

Since neither of us exactly live close to this place, it is a very reasonably assumption that none of us would have ever eaten here if it weren't for the Restaurant.com certificate.  Anyway, come the end of the meal, we present the certificate and were told that they don't accept them and that we should have presented the coupon before the meal.  I hardly ever do that because I always forget but what's the worst that can happen, right?  Well the owner spouted off some bullcrap (like we cared) about some lawsuit with Restaurant.com and that they are a scam and basically we are out of luck with the coupon.  After the owner told us that we should read directions before doing something, he offered to give us a dessert which we declined because at this point it wasn't about the 2 bucks we spent on the coupon.  It was about how this idiot wouldn't honor the face value and doesn't want repeat customer and referral business.  However, in the end, he did comp an $8 appetizer.  He also got 4 people who will never go back and hopefully many more who will read Yelp reviews and not waste their time in the first place.  All this over a measly $25 that he could have easily taken off this bill.\n\nAnyway, if you must go here, here are some other details.  Our waitress was very fast and friendly.  When we were about to order our meals she spouted off a list of about 5 or 6 menu items that they no longer make for some reason which I thought was odd.  They do have a pretty good beer selection and some decent flights.  However, our waitress had almost no idea what beer was what when she brought them to our table.  I bet she just guessed and made it up.  Also, don't ask for a sample of the 4 peaks pumpkin porter because you will be denied because, \"all they get is one keg\" as told by our waitress.\n\nThe food:\n\n* Calamari - pretty good and not overly fried.  Not not enough to share with 4 people though.  I liked the dipping sauce stuff.  Had some kick.\n* Wedge Salad - i thought this was excellent.  It is a pretty standard wedge but with sauteed mushrooms added.  It was a very nice touch and I would actually order it again if I were to return.\n* MC's Burger - this was ok.  Had too much going on I think.  Too many onions, too much sauce, bacon too tough, etc.  The fries were nothing special.\n\nIf the owner wasn't such a douche I would consider returning if I were in the area because they do have some interesting menu items that look interesting and I like beer.  However, he was a douche and there are TONS of other places out there just like it.

I was on a budget and due to poor planning, Global Village Backpackers was the only hostel with a bed available on a Saturday night.\n\nI received a pillow in yellow condition, but I believe it was white at some point in its life.\n\nThe bunkbeds were narrow and there was no guardrail for the top bunk. There were three bunkbeds per room, leaving very little space to maneuver around.\n\nThe outlets in my room did not provide power.\n\nThe furniture was old and there were lots of stains everywhere in the room. Very shoddy environment, from the common room to the bathrooms to the bar to the stair path leading to the rooms. If you cannot tolerate dirty atmospheres, do not come to this hostel! \n\nI fortunately escaped without bedbugs but be aware of this serious issue that everyone else has complained about.\n\nThe staff appeared to be friendly and tried to be helpful, but were incompetent. They seemed to be more interested in playing loud music at the front desk. Linens and towels were not folded and ready to be distributed when I checked in, a sign of procrastination, with an excuse that they had been backed up by the overwhelming amount of guests booking rooms.\n\nThe bar is open to outside people, so you may find bar hoppers looking for cheap drink here. It was interesting to constantly find random drunk people showing up in the Global Village Backpackers lobby and bar. A card key is required to access the guest rooms, so there is no worry that random strangers show up in the rooms. However, the random people were very loud and crazy.\n\nThe guests in my dorm room (6 people) were interesting. A guy came back at 3am and talked on his phone until 4am while the lights were off. Another guy kept waking up to open his luggage zipper for an unidentified reason. Two other guys were non-stop snoring for the entire night. One guy came back from the bar at 3:30am with heavy alcohol stench. If you are coming solo, you might run into similar people in your room. The crowd includes travelers in their 20s and 30s. \n\nThere were no fans or air conditioning in the room. You have to open the window to get any circulation. Unfortunately, you don't just get air, but you also get extremely loud noises from belligerent drunk people screaming on King Street. The constant shouting of crazy people on the streets kept me up all night. If you are a light sleeper, be aware that it is difficult to get any sleep at Global Village.\n\nRenovations to the facilities and improvements to the hygiene at Global Village are required to justify paying $27/night here.

This is evident from the advertising poster quoting \" 'tis the season to give Arby's gift cards\", a poster that should not have been hanging up in late June.

No complainants here as it made for a more flavorful and sweet drink.  I also had a few good sips of the longan fungus dew.  That stuff was thick and interesting.  We were told that the rose fungus dew is a little better.  I wish she told us this before we ordered!  ;P\n\niSnow is located inside the AZ International Market so it's convenient to grab a drink while shopping. They also sell snow and shaved ice.

The cab ride to Rio was quick, as was the disappointment when the staff told us it closed, and again, they had no idea where it had moved to. Finally we figured it out and grabbed a cab downtown. \nNavigating through the complete mess of shady tourists and shadier locals we only found Krave by accident.

The bass was so heavy that when I sat down on an empty \"stage\" I felt like I was going to crap my pants. The lights were awesome but, like the club goers, couldn't fill the space. We had one vodka tonic (or maybe just tonic) and took off. In the elevator my boyfriend leaned up against the wall and was COVERED in lube...seriously the nastiest thing ever. \nThe entire experience was such a disappointment as there are no good gay clubs anywhere in all of sin city for tourists and locals alike and this place has zero potential.

I figured this would be an awesome date night for me and the girl! Yelp doesn't have any reviews on the cooking classes, so I thought I'd give it a shot and leave a detailed review.\n Starting with the options online; there were a ton of different cooking classes. My only gripe with the options was the majority of the classes involved pork dishes. (Which I religiously don't eat) Almost all of the non-dessert cooking classes involved some kind of pork, so I was a bit limited. Either way, we both love sushi so we thought we'd go in to learn how to roll sushi. The menu sounded great. California Rolls, Spicy Salmon Roll, and Vegetable hand roll. The price was $79, more expensive than most cooking classes offered from Sur La Table but I figured why not? Dinner and a great date night and the girl would be happy! \nWhat a disappointment! First of all, the set up. For some reason, I'm not sure if it was a lack of equipment, but they had everyone sharing large bowls to keep aside chopped vegetables. So the vegetables that I chopped up with my hands for mine and my girls sushi, was mixed into the vegetables that the people next to us had chopped up with their hands for their sushi. GROSS!!!!!! It made her and I not even want to eat the sushi, right off the bat! \nNext, the instructor. David Barbour. He told us that he's not so great at rolling some of the sushi. Told us he did all these recipes \"last night\" and is a certified PASTRY chef. I'm sorry, but if I'm paying $79 a PERSON for this, why am I being taught by someone that has only done this once at home? \nNext, the materials. There were about 20 people in the class, for which Sur La Table provided around 8-10oz of salmon.....FOR THE WHOLE CLASS. The \"spicy salmon roll\" was more of a rice roll with the smallest sliver of salmon for each roll. Another big disappointment. And nothing was added to the roll to make it spicy. When I asked the instructor, is this all the salmon we had? He insisted, it's not about the amount of fish in the roll, it's about making sure all of the flavors come through. (Yeah, right) Okay sure, even if that's the case, there was so little salmon that you could hardly taste it in the roll! Next, they said the avocados they had were too ripe so they couldn't provide us any avocado for our rolls since they need to be firm and not mushy... Another mess up by Sur La Table. \nOverall, this class was very very frustrating and not at all worth the price. From the way it was run, it seemed like they were trying to save every dollar they could! With the little amount of salmon provided, to the sharing of vegetables between everyone in the classroom, to hiring a pastry chef to do the work of a real sushi chef, it was a HUGE disappointment and a big waste of money. My girl and I walked away knowing how to roll sushi, but hungry and disappointed with the quality of the cooking class. My friends and family are so happy I advised them not to waste their money by signing up for the Sur La Table cooking classes and I hope this helps yelppers understand what they're getting into! \n\nI only gave it 2 stars because of the amazing selection of products offered at Sur La Table.

The price of the class was $80 and lasted a little over an hour and a half (if you subtract out the time we were told to spend browsing the store over the break as the staff \"cleaned up\").\n\nWhile the class fulfilled the goals indicated, time was not used responsibly and there weren't sufficient materials- for a class of 11, we were given three avocados, a few sad sticks of green onion, two cucumbers, and three carrots to practice chopping. This evens out to about one vegetable per person, so we spent a lot of time watching each other. One package of surimi and ~10oz of tuna was provided for the entire class, which made for extremely small, light rolls. I doubt that over $50 was spent on materials. \n\nThe instructor was polite and I like that he modeled and verbally explained the steps as we worked, but the class could have used another activity or two to fill the allotted time, as well as considerably more fish to work with.

Ironically, I was the only diner on this particular evening, as it was at about closing time. The owner even came to clear my completely cleaned plates, as I went to wash my curried hands apr\u00e8s meal. You see I'd used my hands to eat much of the meal (very glad I was alone, in my private dining area).\n\nAbout a week or so before I had stumbled upon this new, colourful and uniquely decored one off location. It's set among a few other new restaurants in a new construction south of Ste. Catherine St. Out of all the choices including a place that specializes in rich hot chocolate, I dreamt of this place. It's actually Sri Lankan cuisine, which would be my first delectable try. \n \nBefore I start to salivate recalling my mouthwatering finger licking meal, here's what I ate/devoured. It was Tandoori chicken in a brilliant red curry paste sauce. With perfectly crisp red onions, green and red pepper, and sliced carrots. Not like any carrots I've ever had before, in the best way. The same can be said about the house prepared curry paste. Not like any I've ever tasted. Thus, why I dug in fingers first, and used every square inch of napkin. I knew I'd be over stuffed, but managed to eat almost all of the accompanying rotis (a type of moist flatbread). Believe it or not I had already eaten a bowl of their succulent cauliflower puree soup to start. I used a large can of young coconut water to wash down the just-right amount of heat and zing. \n\nWith my sinuses cleared I perused the pristinely clean restaurant and studied the mosaicked tiles and coloured baskets on the wall. I was too full to move, but we all had had a long day of cooking and eating, so as I said in the first paragraph, I washed my curried hands and was thankful for such a special experience, right in the city, but very far from the country of origin.\n\nNote: They have 4 or so chalkboard specials daily.

Wow! That sounds pretty good, non? Except when our burgers arrived (after two hours of waiting) there was only one piece of Haloumi \"bun\" so we couldn't pick them up. We sent the order back, and we got brand new Cheesuses, quick smart. We started to tuck in and realized that there was neither any batter, nor bacon, and the burgers were dry and relied on an ocean of sauce to deliver any flavour. Seriously?

Furthermore,  we could have more choices of type of card games in the game machine.\n\nYes, it was a pricey mistake at the bar. Next we know better than sticking around Wynn's for an early noon drink.\n\nThe only redeeming value was that I ordered a Vodka red bull with Ketel One as my choice of brand. At least they let me keep the rest of the can of Red Bull where most places don't.\n\nIt pay off a little for me as I won $10 at the game machine.

That means I've been fortunate enough to eat at Bistro 990 frequently, but I've never actually had to foot the bill (although I've seen some whopper bills arrive after several bottles of wine).\n\nThe service has always been fantastic; waitstaff are attentive and informed. The pace of a meal is fairly slow, to provide you lots of time to linger over the food and enjoy talking to your companions. If you're expecting a quick meal you'll probably find the pace frustrating, but you'll never find yourself lacking for a drink refill or anything else, your waiter usually shows up with it about half a second before you realize you need something.\n\nMy brother's go-to meal here is the New York striploin, and every time he looks intensely satisfied with the decision. I usually opt for the game of the day -- if it's venison you absolutely owe it to yourself to get it. I once had a rack of caribou so delicious I lost all sense of propriety and high-fived the waiter to express my delight. Every meal I've had, and every meal my companions have had, has been great, so you can safely opt for whatever looks tasty and be confident in your choice.\n\nAs other reviewers have mentioned, Bistro 990 is a celebrity hotspot during the Toronto International Film Festival (I believe in part because many celebrities stay at the Sutton Place hotel, directly across the street). That means if you have the foresight to make a reservation you can dine next to a very drunk Jackie Chan or watch your mother take 17 trips to the bathroom just to walk past Tom Sellek and his legendary moustache.", "business_id": "4YPytg3JVO-vlzx4tBFHbA", "stars": 5, "date": "2010-07-05", "useful": 5, "type": "review", "cool": 4}, {"funny": 5, "user_id": "hpw7UrWf51aaWKbaGGJ2hA", "review_id": "gB_qTqHOYvPQd5EGsoIVRg", "text": "***** 4.5 stars *****\n\nThis was just shy of a perfect rating, but mainly because of the slight disappointment with the main course that may have just been my own silly delusions of grandeur. Overall this is easily one of the best restaurants in Toronto, and certainly one of the most classy as well.\n\nI decided to take a stroll one night in and around the University area, as well as a little bit of Bloor, and finish it up with a walk down through the government part of town, with a brief stop here for a pleasant bite to eat. I ended up staying for an entire dinner, because the menu looked a lot like heaven to me. It's littered with many of my favorite French classics, but I decided to see how well they did with a few non-traditional items.\n\nMy waitress was about 55, and had the most obviously fake French accent I had ever heard. So fake in fact, that it might have been real, nevertheless I found it amusing, and it certainly hinted towards the amount of swank this place implies. She started me off with some relatively worthless bread, which was luckily accompanied by a heap of warm, delicious butter and since I never trust the waitstaff's recommendations, a bottle of pinot noir.\n\nI couldn't resist having some traditional French fare, so I went with the onion soup, which was probably the best decision of the night. You can see in the picture this thing is just overflowing with amazing cheesy goodness, but what you can't see underneath is the perfect sized breadcrumbs and thinly sliced onions that were done exactly the way I like them for this dish. The broth was simply fantastic, I could have bathed in it.\n\nNext up, I went for the crab cake, because I saw the table beside me had ordered one and it was big enough for them to split. Sold me right there. Add in some chipotle mayo and you almost convinced me to get two. It delivered as promised, and the spice kicked ass in a way remoulade could only dream of. Normally chipotle flavors are about as tame as peppers get, but this thing had some fire, props to the chef for taking this one up a notch.\n\nI ended up finishing the night off with what was clearly a huge mistake on my part, passing up on the relatively inexpensive but glorious sounding New York strip topped with bleu cheese, and going for the special of the night, kangaroo with asparagus and mashed sweet potato, in a cabernet reduction. I didn't ask the price at the time, but it ended up being double what the steak was, for equal or less enjoyment, and tack on a bottle of shiraz to go with the pinot noir from earlier and my waitress didn't really care. It looked and tasted basically like beef medallions without all the fat, which for some people might be a bonus, but I LIKE THE FAT! Oh well, lesson learned. I wish the table of Australians who happened to be conveniently sitting right across from me had arrived just a few minutes earlier, as just after I ordered they were discussing how poor kangaroo meat actually was, and that they only served it to sucker tourists.

The accompanying couscous was wonderful.  \n\nBoth times, the dessert was a bit of a let down.  The first time I had the lemon poppyseed cheesecake and it was a little on the sweet side - not quite tart enough.  The second time, I tried the ice cream and cookies.  I recevied two scoops of ice cream - vanilla and chocolate/ coffee.  It was actually pretty good but I was hoping for a more exotic flavour like the blackberry sorbet that accompanied my lemon poppyseed cheesecake.  The cookie was a chocolate chip cookie.\n\nNow, for the service...\n\nThe first time I came, I was there with a bunch of non-mommy friends.  I was the only one who had an infant.

We were greeted in a brick-floored (herringbone!) foyer that was dim and deserted. This only made our journey into the dining room all the more dramatic; Bistro 990 is a warmly-lit and vaulted space filled with the steady sound of happy conversation, and features fascinating hand-painted walls and a convivial and very French atmosphere. Our waitress was even named \"France,\" if that gives you any indication.\n\nI'm trying to enter the mind of a veg-lover this month, so I ordered the Blue Cheese Salad ($10) with roasted hazelnuts. As someone that would cheerfully drive a salad truck into a canyon, I have to admit that I enjoyed this.

It's also newer and less cluttered. Still not wheelchair friendly, but I think a person in a wheelchair has a better chance of getting into the doors than at Hollywood Beauty Supply.\n\nLet me start off with the best pro of them all: They had the entire range of the Christmas collection colors of China Glaze. They had the suede collection from ORLY and OPI. They had such a wonderful selection of the holiday OPI I nearly had a heart attack and died from a nail polish induced hysteria.\n\nThere I was, with 25 bottles of nail polish - my girlfriends and I usually text each other when we get to places like this and ask each other what colors we want/have/don't have/will get/want to get/MUSTHAVE. You understand, right? :)\n\n15 bottles of China Glaze and 10 bottles of OPI... $135.00\n\nI nearly died. It was my fault - I honestly should have asked for the price before dumping everything into my basket. I saw the colors and what could I say? Blinded by the nail polish light. Truly, my bad.\n\nI used to walk about of Hollywood Beauty Supply with 30 bottles of nail polish for a little over $100...and that's all OPI.\n\nTurns out that my bottles of OPI cost me $6 each (at HBS it's $3.50) and China Glaze cost $5.00 (HBS sells for $2.50).\n\nIn total humiliation, I put back ALL the colors. I was so embarrassed. But honestly, I was prepared to spend max $110 for all the bottles. $130 was way out of my price range for what I was willing to spend.\n\nThe man was nice about all of it, but I could tell he was seething underneath it all. I would be, too. At least I put the polishes back in their correct displays.\n\nLong story short, if you're wanting affordable nail polish with the newest and hottest colors of the season, you can come here but be prepared to pay the price. If you want the same thing, but are willing to slap a ho/cut a bitch, go to Hollywood Beauty Supply...your wallet and credit card will thank you.\n\nIf you want to check it out for yourself, Nationwide Beauty Supply is in the new Mekong Plaza Marketplace...I think that's why it's so pricey - they've got to pay their rent.", "business_id": "4Pc6kh6EbsHZEu4G9lFngg", "stars": 3, "date": "2009-10-14", "useful": 2, "type": "review", "cool": 1}, {"funny": 9, "user_id": "Rffpjnip_0zkV0Uga5H1iQ", "review_id": "EkTE-6BxW6ujhV912pAVmA", "text": "Only one guy was manning the line. \n\nThe pizza is ok, nothing great or fancy, and the food is better than Burger King.

LOVE them, so I will say - that is prerequisite #1 to truly enjoy Mamma Mia.\n\nBut that is not what's wrong with me.\nI have now watched THIS show, the Vegas Mamma Mia show, a total of FIVE TIMES.  I kid you not  - five freakin' times.  And.... (hiding head in shame) I loved it all five times!  The last two times, at least I did not start tearing at the end of the show (I'm telling you, I am NOT normal!) but I was still gleeful and on a high when the show ended.  Furthermore - I even watched the SF Mamma Mia.  Once, though.\n\nFolks, this is not a show where you come out with your life changed, and there is no deep meaning.  It is almost silly - very light, but FUN FUN FUN, and just an enjoyable time.  The cast is extremely talented, and some of them are truly amazing singers with outstanding voices.  \n\nI've sat as close as 3 rows back from the orchestra, and all the way back to the second  floor seatings, and while the view was that much better in row 3 - - I found the acoustics to be better further back.\n\nGiven the fact I have watched it so many times, I will say that the mood of the whole show is largely determined by the audience - - I have been there on some nights when it was like every single ABBA whore was there that night (like me, or even worse) and we all go apeshit at the end, dancing to no end, many women sobbing through smiles, and everyone singing like CRAZY.  And 1 or 2 shows were more subdued with an older, more mannered crowd, but I think that applies to any musical.\n\nIf you are looking for a FUN time with a talented cast, and great music, good laughs and just good humor - - try out Mamma Mia at the Mandalay Bay.  In spite of the mediocre ratings some people have given this show - - I think they just expected the wrong thing.  Yeah, the SF show was good  -  but this is a Vegas show.  It's more about having a great time than doing a serious production, British-style.  It's a great twist, in my opinion, to the original.\n\n\nThat said - I am due to go to the SF Mamma Mia (which is comin' back in September 07) and still have to go to the Vegas one ONCE MORE... but that's it.  NO MORE MAMMA MIA FOR ME after that.\n\nEven I have to draw the line at 8 times of watching one show, hahahahah............... unless, of course, I go to Broadway.

No doubt this open-ended run will be here for a long time. The thinnest of plots - a young girl tries to determine, on the eve of her wedding, which of her mother's three one-time suitors is her father - is wrapped around the catalogue of ABBA hits that dominated international pop charts in the 1970s. Some fit into the storyline naturally, while others appear to have been forced in with a sledgehammer, illiciting giggles and groans . . . but nobody walks out unhappy. Clearly you had to have had some affection for the Swedish quartet in its heyday to enjoy this - if not, then head to the nearest casino.

I don't usually go all the way to Utah for drinks, but some friends of ours were throwing a charity wine tasting on a Friday night, so we filled up the car with gas and hit the road.  (Note:  Vino 100 isn't ACTUALLY in Utah.  It's about 15 min north of Desert Ridge).\n\nThe store is very inviting, with wine from floor to ceiling and a bar in the back where they pour tasting samples of select wines (and beer!).  There are several tables throughout for you to sit with your group.  If you sample what they have to offer for free, you are served in a small plastic cup.  But, take that cup of free wine and start perusing the offerings along the wall.  Vino 100 focuses on smaller, lesser known vineyards and I didn't see a bottle that was more than $20.  Each bottle has a brief description, including a chart showing how dry, sweet, bold, etc. that it is.  Pick your bottle, have it uncorked and the fine people at Vino 100 will break out the big wine glasses.  Now, sit back with your friends at a table and feel like the big wheel that you are.  Drink your bottle (or bottles!) and then get up and make another choice.\n\nVino 100 also helps with fundraisers, so you if you work for a worthy cause, give them a call.  On the evening we were there, every bottle purchased helped fund holiday dinners for needy families.

Since it was named after one of my favorite movie's, I had no choice but to order it.  I have to say, \"The dude abides, man.\"  The bread was so incredibly crisp, it rivaled the crunch of the chopped lettuce with each bite.  The coleslaw wasn't too heavy, and the swiss really complimented the thousand island.  \n\nAlbacore Tuna Sub - Flavorful without being drowned in mayonnaise, this tuna was perfectly supported by that wonderful bread.

When I was walking in Southern Highlands back on July 13, I saw that Jimmy Pettyjohn was not on Yelp. It is now and Lavi. S has reviewed it.\n\n Jimmy Pettyjohn Park is a 1.09 acre park in Southern Highlands at the northeast corner of Southern Highlands Parkway at Valley View Boulevard. It is a park serving the local community. It does a good job at this. It is fully gated, which is a good thing if you have little children. There is a state-of-of-the-art shaded playground, shaded gazebo, green grass,  rest rooms, and attractive preipheral landscaping. In the summer, Jimmy Pettyjohn Jr. Park features night time movies.\n\n  When I rate community/neighborhood parks, I rate them differently than regional parks. Due to the tiny size, I am very picky. I look at the condition of the grass and equipment,  connectivity to adjacent land uses, and surrounding area. Jimmy Pettyjohn Park scored well on all of the above. The grass is a perfect shade of green. The playground, gazebo, picnic tables, and equipment were in prime condition. Although there is a need for a parking lot, the park connects nicely with the Southern Highlands community. On my visit, it was part of a hike that included the Paseo Walking Path. And the surrounding neighborhood appears to be safe with graffiti being relatively nonexistent.\n\n  I am impressed with Jimmy Pettyjohn Jr. Park. However, I will not drive out of my way to Southern Highlands to visit it. It is a park that functions more as a community green space for Southern Highlands residents instead of Yelpers such as myself that reside in another part of the valley.", "business_id": "054_-sJ-nYq_DsuWYgqNdg", "stars": 4, "date": "2013-07-22", "useful": 8, "type": "review", "cool": 7}, {"funny": 4, "user_id": "eK6FpEPv2urKpEjWwR45QQ", "review_id": "m8ZVZHWlI-1yfqTRERntOg", "text": "My experience here was awesome from start to finish.

We switched to a booth and the ambiance was better there but they still had bright lights that shined down hurt my eyes and as such I wasn't a fan. The service was both friendly and excellent so kudos there! No complaints at all with that.\n\nHowever, we couldn't quite figure out what they were trying to do at this place. There was an area with couches and a DJ booth. They were playing old school hip hop and the DJ would get on the mic here and there and encourage us to buy shots, etc. I must say it was kind of comical. We had already heard \"Ice Ice Baby\" and \"The Humpty Dance\" and I started to feel like I was in a time warp. Instead of being at a sushi bar, I felt like I was sipping on a Zima and doing shots of Goldschl\u00e4ger at the 18 and over club, Kokomo's in Irvine, that I used to sneak into with a fake ID back in the day. At this point, I started giggling uncontrollably because the whole vibe seemed so lame. My friend and I decided that we would make a request for the DJ, so we googled \"cheesy 80s old school hip hop songs\" and I shit you not that every song we had heard so far was on that list. Armed with a $5 bill, I sent my friend to tip the DJ and suggest some of the silliest songs from that list while we continued to laugh and lipsynch as they wound up playing them on their rotation. We were having a great time...\n\nUnfortunately, the food was not as great of an experience. My Christmas Tree roll that was recommended by the waiter was bland because there was so much tempura on it. And while I did think that the Asian tapas idea was a keeper, the portions were extremely small for pretty expensive prices. As a footnote, I came before their prices were lowered. Those that are familiar with my reviews know that I don't mind paying top dollar for food but the quality and portion sizes did not warrant what we were being charged. The salmon poke with peanut sauce was downright odd. While I like both of those two things on their own, they didn't go well together. I was hoping they would because I had read a review that mentioned one of the guys from Top Chef was somehow involved with Xtreme and I trusted that because of that, the chef must know what was up. While he may very well have created the menu for this restaurant, I am willing to wager a rather large bet that he was not the one preparing or plating our food that evening because the food was not up to par. Maybe if he had been, our experience might have held true to the \"Woohoo! As good as it gets!\" reviews that got me in the door in the first place.\n\nOverall, Xtreme has potential but I think they need to work on a lot of things. I debated whether or not to write this review because I'm not the type to kick somebody while they are down and I didn't want to be the first person to say something negative. However, I felt like I was doing both Yelpers as well as this place a disservice by not expressing my honest opinions. If everyone keeps blowing smoke up their ass, they might not ever get it together. And if they don't change for the better and soon, it's sad to say but my prediction is that they will end up meeting the same fate as their predecessor. I'm actually rooting for these guys though. I will be continuing to watch the reviews to see if they end up turning it around.

You'll know when you see pictures of pizza.\n\nR.P. is right. The customer service here is above and beyond. The Weekly article had the wrong hours listed (K-Jun closes with the rest of the food court, 9 p.m. on Saturdays). We came in at 9 thinking we had plenty of time. The young gentleman behind the counter, being well-informed, knew we were there because of the mix up. We said we would gladly return during business hours. I mean there's a million great places to eat around there. He then blew my mind. He said he would stay late to make us a pizza. What an insane offer! I felt terrible taking it, but he insisted. So my food companion tipped him well to make his time worth it. He let us order the $20 special. It had a pizza, chicken and two drinks. It's advertised to feed 4+ and it definitely did. He was so generous that I was scared he would get in trouble. I bet he would be the most best friend you could ever have. Someone like this man is such a gem of a person. I would want him to be my partner on Survivor. He even checked on us through our meal.\n\nThe food though is really cool. Korean pizza, HELLO! The bulgogi potato pizza had bits of bulgogi beef, corn, potatoes and other things I'm sure. The pizza sauce was an orangey color and tasted like pasta sauce. The crust seemed to have plenty of cheese  crusties- gooood. It was pretty alright. I wish it came frozen for me to take home. Don't judge me. We had our chicken half plain and half in sauce. I never had chicken like this. The crust is really thick and crunchy. We couldn't put our finger on it and at last we realized it had cinnamon. How cool! We devoured the pickled radishes that came with it. The kind man said they are perfect together. Oh, and he was so right. I love hiiiiim! The other half had a sticky spicy sweet sauce on it. It was good, but I personally prefer the plain. Too messy. The actual chicken pieces come small, but were not dry. I did come across the occasional bone which I find nostalgic.\n\nSo if the Weekly made you curious like me, you should go. I'm remembering and cherishing the time with that chicken , radish and pizza.

They were fresh, sweet, and crunchy. I never had those things before. \n\nThe Korean Pizza was probably the best thing on the menu. It had sweet potatoes and Korean BBQ beef on it. The beef they got on the pizza is way better than 90% of the Korean restaurants in town. \n\nPersonally, I like the plain chicken over the one with the sauce. \n\nThe portions were pretty big, and they hand batter and fry your chicken the moment you order it. \n\nThis is a pure fusion style restaurant. They also give Tapatio with your chicken and pizza.   Lon L's review was 100% accurate about how the chicken wasn't your traditional Korean fried chicken.   Most Korean fried chickens are very similar to a American southern fried chicken, but with a hint of sesame oil and soy sauce. Traditional Korean fried chicken is prepared by battering the whole chicken without cutting the pieces apart, unlike in America where they batter the individual pieces. Then the whole chicken is flash fried in a pit of boiling oil. After only a couple of seconds they hand you the whole f*cking chicken still in one piece!\n\nWhen I was a little kid in California, I used to eat at this Korean fried chicken place that would actually deep fry the chicken in a combination of Vegetable and  Sesame oil. It was really good.  The chicken here at K-Juns tastes more similar to Tang Su Yuk(spelling). It's covered in a very sticky sweet-sour-spicy sauce. The good news for me is that I really like Tang Su Yuk, so ended up finding the chicken to be enjoyable. \n\nOriginally, I did not want to come here but, my Mom kept insisting on eating here when she came to town recently. My mom went weird a little over a decade ago. She started acting very oddly and her speech pattern became pretty disturbed and strange. While I was driving to Greenland market with her, we had two conversations. The first one was about \"starbucks coffee sent me a free drink coupon\". And the 2nd conversation was about how: \"A friend of mine who is Hawaiian said that K-Jun chicken was bad, so I don't want to eat there\". But, my Mom insisted that she wanted to try it. When we finally got there, she went up to the counter, and incoherently told the worker: \"Starbucks Chicken is bad Hawaiian food\". Now, everywhere my mom goes this happens.   And, everywhere we go people lose there patience with how nutty she is. Workers everywhere can't stand her and get really rude to her.  But, that didn't happen here at K Jun Chicken. The worker was very understanding and sensitive. He never got irritated, never laughed at her, or lost his patience. And he helped my Mom order exactly what she was looking for. It was very nice of him, and I appreciate his kindness. The respectful personality that this worker possesses is exactly what I would expect from a true East Asian person. There used to be a time when Asian-Americans had integrity and honor. We used to respect our elders and not make fun of the disabled. Nowadays a lot of Asian guys here in America(especially the ones around my age) talk all girly and act all snotty, passive-aggressive, and rude to each other. It's literally impossible  to get a long with them.  And a lot of Asian girls are like self-hating(especially at college campuses) and always rant about how they wish they were white and how \"the White man is the superior human being\". Like for example: I had a nightmare situation at a Korean owned sushi place in California where the self-hating Asian girl who was working there immediately let me know that she hated me for being Asian, male, and alive. She didn't even ask me about how many people where in my party, instead she just comes up to me and says all that. Then she kept coming back over and showing me pictures of her white boyfriend on her Iphone, and then started making remarks about how \"Asian guys are ugly and all look alike\". And at the end she made a comment about how Asian men \"oppress women\" and how \"it's not in the white man's nature to treat women badly\".  She wouldn't leave us alone! I believe that if my Mom came into that Sushi restaurant with her mental condition, the Asian chick would have kicked her out. The only reason I stayed was because the owner invited us there that day for a free meal.  And the only reason I haven't left a negative Yelp review on that place is because the owner used to be my next door neighbor. But, moral of this story is that you won't get that kind of treatment here at K-Juns. All you get is respect and good service from traditional East Asian workers. None of that f*cked up sh!t. \n\nOverall, I am happy I came into a Korean restaurant this time and didn't get dissed.

What this means is that for the frequent traveller who appreciates having a lounge to work/sleep/relax, this is a great membership to have. There are 3 levels and I currently have the Prestige Membership at $399 USD per year. This level gains entry to all lounges with no fee and one additional guest can join at $27 USD per visit.\n\nTerminal 3 International Flight Departures - Toronto Pearson \n\nThe Priority Pass lounge at Terminal 3 also shares the lounge with Plaza Premium and American Express (Platinum and Centurion cardholders only). There are several Plaza Premium/Priority Pass/Amex lounges in Terminal 3, but the one I went to was close to gate C32. This lounge is very large and comfortable, and the day my parents and I utilized, it was empty. We were duly impressed and found it better than the Maple Leaf lounge. There are comfortable cushy lounge chairs that line the wall overlooking the airplanes as well as ample desks to eat/work, 4 computer stations with free internet (one hooked up to a printer), luggage storage, and bathrooms (this lounge did not have shower facilities).\n\nThere is a wide variety of food (hot and cold) and for our visit, they had a rendition of Beef Stroganoff, steamed potatoes and vegetables and fried rice. The lounge also had a salad and cereal bar, bread station and dessert varieties (cookies, muffins, fruits). The drink selection was equally large with white and red wines, aperitifs, beers and liqueurs (I started my vacation with a spicy Bloody Ceasar...woo hoo!) Standard water and juices are of course available.\n\nAll in all, this is a great lounge and I will definitely be using my Priority Pass more often. I find that out of all the PP lounges accessed, the one in Pearson's Terminal 3 is the better of the lot (yeah Pearson for once)! For travelers who frequently purchase Business/First class tickets, than this membership would be moot as lounges are a part of the ticket. Overall, a great membership to have.\n\nFYI. This lounge also accepts non-membership guests (single entry) at a price. 2 hours duration is $30 CDN and 3 hours is $35 CDN - this is not a bad price considering all the amenities (including free Wi-fi and plenty of outlets to charge your laptop/iPad). No reservations are required for membership - just pop-in and check-in at the counter.\n\nTip. Some airports require passengers to pass through security check first then you can access the lounge (like at Pearson). At other airports, you have to access the lounge first then check-in at the security station (which means you are at your gate like at the Athens International Airport). Just be warned because we made the mistake of passing through the security check in Athens thinking we could access the lounge after, however, it meant that we were outside our gate for 4 hours. The lounge was before the security check.

We order the following, with parentheses providing a brief summary of the outcome:\n\n*  3 bison burgers (Fine, 3 star burger maybe, homemade, BUT, came fully dressed with mustard, ketchup, relish... each of us had to scrape condiments off.  Who does that?  Let us dress our own freakin' burger.  we'll call 'em 2.5, then.)\n\n*  3 pulled pork poutine (Nasty frozen fries, ice cold un-squeeky curd, mediocre gravy, mediocre pork... BAD, so much so that two orders went mostly uneaten.  1.0)\n\n*  1 nachos (Competitor for worst nachos ever that weren't intending irony or insult; covered in crappy cheap black olive slices and scuz cheese, with very, very stale no-name brand nachos.  Sent back after a few people at the table sampled and rebuffed.

Good job!  Went unfinished.  Another zero.)\n\n*  3 Fin du Monde, 1 Mill St Coffee, 1 Cider, 1... Stella I want to say?  (All were from bottles, none skunked, so that's good, but the price was a bit on the high side... nothing outrageous, but 50 cents to $1 higher than I would expect at most bars.  3.0 'cuz they had Fin du Monde... we'll be generous!

To exacerbate his suckitude, at one point he was smoking in the alley that joins the main bar and the patio, just outside the door -- the smoke was blowing into the bar, and we asked him if he could move away a bit.  He nodded yes, but then didn't move an inch.  We asked him politely for something simple, and he was a prick about it.  Swell.\n\nTo top it all off, as someone else mentioned: Ciro's has the NASTIEST MEN'S ROOM IN THE CITY.  It stinks so bad you have to hold your breath.  It is filled with fruit flies and some kind of weird moth things.  The urinal literally sprays water out at you when you flush.  And the toilet... the toilet is covered in some kind of disgusting, slimy substance upon which the fruit flies and moths appear to be subsisting.  When you're scared to wash your hands after taking a piss, that says a hell of a lot.\n\nOh, as for that great beer list that supposedly recommends this place:  it's fine but nothing great, and the prices are higher than they should be considering they're just readily available bottles.

VERY. Complete with tinny muzak from ceiling speakers. I was there for 3 and a half or so hours, and saw maybe 8 other clientele while waiting in the lounge or walking around. All were at least twice my age and well dressed. The vibe is nice with soft lighting, but very clinical. Not clinical in the high-gloss-white-finish-super-minimal like I like, but clinical in a White-coats-tight-smiles-products-in-matching-white-boxes-lining-the-walls-Mary-Kay kind of way. \n\nThe massage was with Gregory who was REALLY strong. Pressure was hard and amazing, I feel fantastic today. This was a high modesty massage. Gregory revealed, honestly, like several inches of my body at a time, making sure I was as most covered as possible for the entire process. If you are concerned with showing your bits this is definitely the place for a modest massage.  Additionally, He covered my back in heating pads to make sure my muscles were very warm which was great, and highly effective. It was a really good massage. \n\nMy other treatments were done by Irene, who was friendly, professional, easy to chat with and very good at her job. I was really pleased by all three treatments and would highly advise requesting her if you need an esthetician. My eyebrows are GORGEOUS today and my face feels super soft. \n\nMinus Points. \n\n-The lounge is set up like a conversation area, which is a little awkward if you are sitting with several other people.  It feels like your great aunts living room. \n- When sitting in the lounge there is alot of noise from \"outside\" in the path. I looked past the partition and you could see people using the bank machine about 2 feet from your robed self. \n- The entire process was a little slow. there was alot of sitting around between procedures. \n- When I went to pay, there was a basket with all of the products used on me, in case I wanted to purchase anything, and they were pricey.  \n- No Steam Room, Sauna, Pool anything like that. \n\nIf you are spending your mother to a spa, this is the right place.

Why bother opening your doors on Saturday if all your gonna do is serve us food that was cooked earlier and is sitting in his heating lamp area all day drying out and just getting nasty?  There is a giant hot case and all your choices are in there sitting in various bowls (pork bowl, brisket bowl, etc) and then there were two giant bowls of old ass mac and cheese that had no taste whatsoever and was all crusted up and hard by the time it made into my to-go box.

Uniformed woman at the counter, who looked more like she was the cleaning lady, claimed its because the brisket is more expensive. Well, after trying Brian Banasek's brisket, that meat should be lesser money than the others. I also got overcharged for one of those cans of Arizona Iced Tea that says 99 cents on the label. Are they charging me $1.50 for that drink because Banasek is a price gouger that likes jacking up prices and ripping off his customers? That's the only conclusion I could come too.\n     For some reason the counter woman put pork and brisket on my sandwich. If it wasn't for the color, both meats could resemble eachother. Stringy, dry brisket (some burnt ends) served with a horrible thick, molasses based? BBQ sauce that is loaded with sugar and just is horrendous. The mac and cheese was perhaps the worst ever, sporting some various colorful peppers in the dish and no cheese at all.

Having heard that this modest-looking church is the site of some of the best Lenten eats in PGH, I'd been angling to try it (pun fully intended...) for nearly a year.  On my last visit on Good Friday 2015, I tried to call ahead but was unsuccessful, and by the time I made it to the church (after getting turned around twice!) at 6pm, they were out of the goods.  This year, however, my persistence and timing paid off, and I was able to put in a phone order and pick it up at 5:30pm today (the Friday prior to Good Friday).\n\nAs of the time I put in my order (4:30pm), they were out of baked fish, so I ordered two fried fish dinners ($9 each)--one for me, and one for my (normally GF) friend--and a side of mac and cheese ($2.25).  Despite making the order upon arrival, instead of ahead of time, pick up was fairly efficient, taking about 10 min.  Rather than eating in, my friend and I opted to take advantage of the pleasant weather and head down to the Pump House at the Waterfront to consume our meal.\n\nThe fried fish meal consisted of a fried fish sandwich containing no fewer than 3 hand-breaded fish fillets plus fries and cole slaw.  The fish was absolutely sublime, with a delicately crispy coating and a flaky interior--easily the best fish I've had at any fish fry.  Moreover, the roll was of an appropriate size and shape and stood up to its contents well--something that I've learned not to take for granted at PGH fish fries.  I didn't try the cole slaw, but it appeared to be of the creamy variety, and my friend enjoyed it.  The fries were pretty typical, but could have used more salt (unfortunately, salt and pepper packets weren't included with the other condiments with our order).  As for the mac and cheese, it was creamy and cheesy, and was a step up from any of the other versions I've had at a fish fry.\n\nNeedless to say, Holy Angels' fish fry lived up to my elevated expectations.  One thing worth mentioning is that serious persistence is needed to place a phone order--it took me 7 calls to finally get through (I believe I gave up after 8 last year).  However, if you are able to get through--or if you're able to make it out in a timely manner, this fish fry is definitely a gem, and is well worth a trip into this obscure pocket of PGH to experience this Lenten treat at its best.", "business_id": "4PRtBWAtJvrRE-8Hm4UPig", "stars": 5, "date": "2016-03-19", "useful": 14, "type": "review", "cool": 17}, {"funny": 4, "user_id": "XEHZoTDWjw3w-gcQyYIe4g", "review_id": "GPcQwXRZYH2pqflbKWTKXA", "text": "I enjoyed my time at the hoot.

Two ravenous young women ineffectively shielded by their flimsy old umbrellas hastily made their way down Avenue road in the hopes that they would soon find shelter from the unyielding downpour. An unearthly rumbling frightened the girls until they realized that it was, in fact, their poor protesting bellies crying out for sustenance.

I did a blend class after fasting for 9 days and absolutely fell in love. Even though I was too weak at the time to keep up with everyone, I still completed the class. Don't let whatever issue you have keep you from these classes! All fitness levels can take these classes because they're tailored to you and you will definitely see your body becoming stronger in time.\n\nAfter the first class, I was hooked. The next week I signed up for an entire year of unlimited classes for $600 (promotional rate.) There are various promotional rates for different increments of time. Currently, a week of unlimited classes is $20. Totally worth it. \n\nNow, I've gone to tons of their classes and I can't recommend this place enough. Since my time here, I've tried every Surfset class that is offered and have begun taking their new Hot Hula and belly dance classes. (I've yet to try their off-board yoga classes because it doesn't fit in with my weird work schedule.)\n\nThere are four different classes offered and each session is different - you'll never get tired of doing the same routine over and over. \n\nMaybe you're wondering how this whole thing works. Basically, each class you're on a surfboard that sits about 6- 8 inches off of the ground on a stand. Inside the stand are three small balance balls that the board rests upon. On each side of the board are two bungee cords that can be hooked to the stand to stabilize your board. As you become stronger and more comfortable using the board, you can remove one or both of the stabilizing bands to challenge yourself. I've been doing this since February and am only using one stabilizing band.\n\nAs far as Surfset classes that are offered, there are four basic types and each run about 45 minutes:\n\nBuild: Using kettlebells, slosh tubes, and resistance bands on the board, you'll be able to do squats, swings, flies, and all sorts of body weight exercises build your muscles. Tends to be a slower paced but killer workout.\n\nBalance: A good class for beginners or people who believe that they're not so good at staying balanced. Slower pace class focuses on doing squats, planks, various yoga poses, and floor to board moves. Advance balance classes focus on doing more moves while laying on your back. Usually I combine a balance and a build class back to back because of the fact they're slower paced classes.\n\nBurn: High intensity cardio class. If you love to do lots of floor to board work, jumps, hops, and jogging, you'll love this class. Personally, I hate cardio so I tend to stay away from this class unless I aboslutely can't fit anything else into my schedule - but lots of people love it.\n\nBlend: A combination class that encorporates moves and pace from Build, Balance and Blend classes. This is my go-to class. There are basically two sections of  build, balance and burn classes, with 3 moves repeated twice per section with a \"surf session\" at the end. Moves from each class and which moves are repeated are always different. Advance classes utilize more difficult moves and moves are 3 combination moves, each in turn made up of 3 moves. Advanced classes can be quite challenging but a killer and fun workout.\n\nJason and his team are absolutely incredible. When I first began I was going every day. Now that summer is here, my work schedule isn't permitting me to come as often thanks to my coworkers going on vacation like crazy. Luckily once summer is over (soon!!!) I'll be back to my daily grind here. Jason and his team are so cool, so friendly, and really encouraging. I feel bad when I don't get to come to class - not because I feel guilty, but because I feel like my week wasn't as fun or fulfilling if I'm not there each day.\n\nRecently Hot Hula classes were added. No, you don't take hula in a hot room, it's \"hot\" as in sexy! I absolutely love coming to class and while I was pretty rusty at first, I feel I've gotten way better at picking up sequences and counting. Classes are an hour and by the end, I'm always pouring sweat but having the BEST time. Even more recently, belly dance classes were added. They're not your tradtional Egyptian classes - more of a tribal type that is set at a slower pace and to trance like music.\n\nLike I mentioned before, I've yet to take the yoga classes but I feel I already have a pretty full plate already. Honestly, the only reason, and I do mean ONLY reason I don't want to leave Vegas as much as I dislike living here is because I wouldn't get to come here anymore. I love the people, the trainers and the classes here.

Once you get the hang of it this class is a blast!\n\nWe did squats, push-ups, down dog and jump up on the board like you are actually catching a wave. It would be hard to not have fun in this class. \n\nThey offer several different class options. One with resistance bands, a cardio one, and a combination of both. They offer single sessions, a package of sessions, monthly unlimited and annual unlimited. You can also have private sessions if you wish so then you look like a Surf Pimp in the class and show us all up. \n\nOverall I am super stoked about this gym and the Instructors.

When I got there I asked about the Aromatherapy massage, as I like a very relaxing time with scented oils and such. The girl at the front explained that you must be completely naked and it's done by a woman. All of this seemed perfectly legit. I mean, it's a \"family\" sauna, right? I wasn't sure how comfortable I was with being completely naked, but I figured I'd suspend my shyness for a day and see what it was all about.\n\nWell...\n\nI sheepishly entered she shower area (and I will agree with a previous reviewer who likened it to something from a horror film), showered and lowered myself into the hot tub, waiting for my masseuse. But how was I to know who she was? Should I get out and wait? But I would be waiting naked in a women's shower! That's just far too creepy a thing to do. Eventually, a woman came in in her bra and underwear with a caddy full of massage things. She scanned the shower quickly and saw me \"Number 22?\" She asked? I was relieved. She showed me to the massage area where there was another woman lying tits up on a table being rubbed all over. Um... was this going to be me? But it seemed to late to back out now--even rude, maybe to say I wasn't comfortable with this. But I was already naked and thinking that I couldn't get any more.\n\nLying naked on my stomach, I felt a hard press on my calves. I was about to ask her to not rub so hard, but when I looked back, I saw that she was STANDING on my legs with her hands on the wall, holding her up. 10 minutes later I was covered in oil with this Korean woman on my back, sliding back and forth and working my muscles in a way that can only be akin to mild torture. It hurt so badly, and when I asked her to use a lighter touch, she ignored me.  This was definitely far out of my comfort zone, but I reasoned that it was no big deal and probably normal in Korea.\n\nI actually have bruises from this massage (I am incredibly sensitive and bruise easily) My skin is in pain. BUT, my muscles are incredibly knot free and my body feels better than it has in years. So in the end I would say that it was worth the hour of pain and embarrassment.\n\nAfter showering all the oil off, I went tot he massage studio for my foot massage, which was wonderful and relaxing.\n\nI liked all of the saunas, but my favourite was the one that was medium hot. I lounged on the smooshy black couches and waited for my sushi to arrive. I tried a baked egg and it was wonderfully nutty and delicious.\n\nI'd say that this was a day well spent. Relaxation, a completely new experience in massage and a super chill environment.  My only criticisms are that maybe they could go a little easier on me next time. Maybe I'm missing the 'no pain, no gain' mantra, because it did work. Also, for a duration of time in the early afternoon, there was a dog barking incessantly from another room. This was not the most relaxing noise.

There's like six garbage bins sitting outside the station and still, plenty of banana peels and urine stains and random crap everywhere.  If you use the Emerson exit, you'll barf from the 8973 stairs you have to climb, and the collection of garbage piling up outside. I saw an inverted bag of poop flying around that station. DISGUSTING.  The residents of this area are so nasty.  DO NOT park in that parking lot next to the station.  I saw some nasty lady turning tricks in cars in that very parking lot! She then urinated on a car after the jon sped away.  She kept shouting \"5 dolla, 10 dolla\" to every guy who walked by. DISGUSTING. Wash your car and bring hand sanitizer if you park in that lot. I've seen far more DISGUSTING things happen in that parking lot.  I've seen things that no man, woman or child should ever even know exist.

Nach gef\u00fchlten 100 Jahren Planung wurde dann schlussendlich 2007 die Neue Messe Stuttgart in Betrieb genommen.\n\nDirekt vis a vis vom Stuttgarter Flughafen und direkt an der A8 und damit quasi in direkter Einflug- und Einfallschneise aller Besucher mussten massenweise Kraut\u00e4cker diesem Gro\u00dfprojekt weichen.\n\nNun steht sie da - neun Hallen auf mehreren Ebenen umschlie\u00dfen ein begr\u00fcntes Atrium, in dem man in der w\u00e4rmeren Jahreszeit die pflasterm\u00fcden F\u00fc\u00dfe entspannen kann. Die Ebenen der Messehallen sind durch s\u00e4mtliche analogen und digitalen Verbindungsm\u00f6glichkeiten erschlossen. Analog-Treppen, Rolltreppen und Aufz\u00fcge chauffieren die Besucher von a nach b. Die Wege sind weit, die Hallen riesig. Sp\u00e4testens nach der dritten Halle nutzt keiner mehr freiwillig die Analog-Treppe und greift gerne auf dem Komfort einer Rolltreppe zur\u00fcck.\n\nReist man - so wie ich- mit dem Auto an, findet man sich alsbald auf einem gigantischen Parkplatz wieder, von dem man innerhalb einiger Laufminuten zum Haupteingang kommt. Hier wurde eigenwillig geplant. Bei Fachmessen wie der Blech-Expo (kein Witz!), mag sich der Besucher-Ansturm noch in Grenzen halten. Bei vielbesuchten Verbrauchermessen allerdings ger\u00e4t der Eintritt zu einer Art Schlacht bei den Thermopylen... Massen von Besuchern pressen sich durch zwei putzig dimensionierte Dreht\u00fcren, die nicht von Motoren, sondern von Manpower durch Selbstschieben angetrieben werden. Hier bewegt man sich nun wahlweise wegen akuter Verstopfung in Trippelschritten durch das Dreh-Element, oder man hat einen einigerma\u00dfen freien Moment erwischt und darf sich die T\u00fcr mit einem selbsternannten Hobby-Rambo teilen. Dann hilft nur ein beherzter Hechtsprung, bevor man die T\u00fcr im Kreuz hat und an der n\u00e4chsten Glasscheibe havariert. Hier h\u00e4tte man sicherlich besser arbeiten k\u00f6nnen...\n\nDer Eingangsbereich h\u00e4lt Kassen, eine Garderobe und Toiletten bereit. Die Kassen sind bei \u00f6ffentlichen Messen proppenvoll und die Schlangen daher ellenlang. Hier offenbart sich ein weiterer Konstruktionsfehler... Die Schlangen stehen dann genau so, dass man nicht zum Eintrittsbereich der Messehallen vorsto\u00dfen kann, ohne sich in Jump and Run-Manier durch die wartende Masse zu schl\u00e4ngeln.\n\nHat man den \"Durchbruch\" geschafft, h\u00e4lt man sein Ticket unter ein Leseger\u00e4t. Im Optimalfall blinkt dann ein gr\u00fcnes Licht, ein Display w\u00fcnscht einen sch\u00f6nen Besuch und das Drehkreuz wird freigegeben.\n\nNun kann der geneigte Gast f\u00fcr seine zuvor entrichteten 12 Euro Eintritt alle Hallen ablaufen und sich in Ruhe umsehen. Oft sind mehrere Messen parallel (siehe Stuttgarter Messeherbst) und der guckende Besucher macht massig Kilometer. Treibt der kleine oder gro\u00dfe Hunger, stehen zahllose Futterbuden bereit. Sandwiches, Cr\u00eapes, Chinanudelboxen, Hotdogs und auch die obligatorische Messeforelle (W\u00fcrstchen mit Fritten) l\u00e4cheln den hungrigen Messegast an. Beim Blick auf die Preise weicht der Hunger einem dezenten Grausen. Acht Euro f\u00fcr ein paar labberige Chinanudeln mit Dosengem\u00fcse in einer Pappschachtel sind dann doch etwas happig.\n\nHat der geneigte Besucher nach etlichen Stunden seinen Rundgang beendet, strebt er v\u00f6llig fu\u00dflahm dem Ausgang entgegen, quetscht sich erneut durch die Thermopylen und stakst zum Parkscheinautomaten. Die Insertion des Tickets gipfelt in kaltem Grausen... pro Stunde nimmt der Betreiber Apcoa l\u00e4ssige 2 Euro. Ein Tagesticket gibt es nicht. Uff. Frau l\u00f6st zerknirscht ihr Auto aus und fragt sich auf dem nun endlos erscheinenden Weg zum Parkplatz, ob freundliche Menschen in der Zwischenzeit das Auto massiert und mit Bier gef\u00fcttert haben. Dem ist nicht so - der schwarze L\u00f6we wartet unver\u00e4ndert angegraut vom Schotterstaub auf Frauchens R\u00fcckkehr. Der Kartenfresser an der Schranke kassiert das Ticket und w\u00fcnscht noch eine gute Fahrt.\n\nAlles in allem ist das neue Messegel\u00e4nde ganz h\u00fcbsch geraten. Futuristisch geschwungene D\u00e4cher, Ruhebereiche in gro\u00dfer Zahl und ein sch\u00f6nes gr\u00fcnes Atrium. Die Eintrittspreise sind in Ordnung, die Getr\u00e4nke- und Essenspreise wahnsinnig hoch... Von den Parkgeb\u00fchren ganz zu schweigen. Der Eingang ist eine Katastrophe.\n\nSumma summarum drei Sterne.", "business_id": "M6UdBYaeCOQRtO_BJZricQ", "stars": 3, "date": "2015-09-29", "useful": 8, "type": "review", "cool": 7}, {"funny": 10, "user_id": "EhO5C7t3yfGFLvsTyK5PPw", "review_id": "W46kCvvLowOjwDXEni6wWg", "text": "I have this reoccurring nightmare that I'm trapped on a cruise ship that sets sail but never seems to stop in a port anywhere. It is sort of like a floating Hotel California where you can check out but you can never leave. I'm surrounded by mawkish middle aged people dressed like extras in Saturday Night Fever (or Priscilla Queen of the Desert except they aren't doing drag, it's for real) and the DJ just keeps playing K.C. and the Sunshine Band over and over and over again. That's the way I like it, uh huh uh huh.....oh God, please just kill me now. Then I wake up, in a cold sweat and there is a flood of relief as I realize that it was in fact just a dream. At least it was.....until a few days ago. \n\nMy husband's company opted to celebrate their company Christmas party a little bit differently this year so they hosted it at Stage West in Mississauga. SW is your basic dinner theatre. The trough opens up at 6:30 p.m. so you have 96 minutes to do your best Caligula imitation, literally shovelling food into your gullet to be follow by an array of edible oil products for dessert. Then right on the nose at 8:06 p.m. you get spend the next two hours being subjected to a dinner show that is tantamount to a bad cabaret show that appears nightly on that Love Boat Cruise ship nightmare of mine. \n\nThe buffet reminded me of one of those buffets you'd find in Bumfuck, Idaho with an AYCE for $3.99 sign out front but the food is so bad that all you can stand is about a buck's worth. You can tell they are catering to an older demographic because you need no teeth to eat any of the food at this buffet. Turkey roll smothered in beige paste (aka turkey gravy), instant scalloped potatoes, clams casino and a myriad of salads that are so shredded and pulped you could suck them up through a straw. This is all good news if you've forgotten to use your Polident. \n\nI'm convinced that the actual buffet steam table is used during the daytime hours for the spa services because after standing over it for a few minutes I'd swear I just had a facial. Even my glasses were fogged up. It's a two for one service at this trough.....supper & spa all at the same time. \n\nThen the real fun begins. It's show time. The featured show this holiday season is called \"One Hit Wonders\". Half way through it I'm thinking to myself that I like to hit the guy who came up with this show just one time, now that would truly be my idea of a one hit wonder. Do you know how hard it is to sit and listen to songs like My Sharona, I Never Promised You a Rose Garden, Tainted Love, Torn Between Two Lovers and Hooked On A Feeling? Hell, it's tough enough just to hear those songs but have someone sing them an octave off key and you'll be begging to be euthanized. They should ship this crew off to Libya where they could teach torture tactics with this song lineup. Someone please wake me up out of this fuck-a-delic crap-tastic show from hell and tell me this isn't for real and that people haven't actually paid their hard earned money for this shite. There isn't enough alcohol on the premises to make this song and dance troupe look or sound good. \n\nThe grand finale icing on this nightmare in real time comes after the show when the DJ fires up the disco songs and the stage gets turned into a dance floor, replete with lasers and disco lights. The 70's & the 80's are alive and well on Dixie Road. Can someone please tell me why a middle aged woman would possibly wear a shimmery halter dress that is two sizes too small with absolutely no support and then proceed to shake her booty (and a whole lot of other stuff) and think it actually looks attractive. I felt nauseous and embarrassed just watching it. Not to be outdone, the comb over crowd joined in, with shirts unbuttoned to their navels as they reminded us that they were Staying Alive while jiggling their over the hill hairy man boobs. I need Gravol. Please let this ship be the Titanic. \n\nAn evening at Stage West will set you back an unbelievable $75 plus taxes per person. Bar prices are ridiculous. A couple glasses of really crappy, shitty, lip puckering wine would set you back twenty bucks. The one consolation I took out of all this was knowing that on the Monday following this Friday night of funkadelic fun-tastic-mess there would be a Christmas bonus cheque for my husband from his employer. \n\nA small consolation for the nightmare on Dixie Road that is Stage West.

Upon our arrival, there was a private room setup with four large tables arranged in a fashion to comfortably seat our large group. The setting was in order for the memorable meal that followed. \n\nA three course prix fixe menu was offered as a value to those who didn't wish to order from the full menu. Our server, admittedly new to Lago, was plenty attentive and patient with our group. \n\nTo start, my accomplice and I shared a bowl of steamed mussels and clams in a white wine garlic broth. The clams, I am unhappy to report, tasted gritty from sand left unrinsed. The broth, nothing I couldn't have constructed at home. \n\nNext, I had the grilled lamb chops with pumpkin gratin, brussels sprouts and pomegranate vinaigrette. Now, I've ordered lamp chops at other fine dining establishments and have only received a small chop or two of this delicate meat as an entire entr\u00e9e (I'm talking to you Johnny's Downtown). At Lago, I was served an entire rack of lamb with about 8 ribs each! Cooked to my choice of medium rare, they knocked this dish out of the park and certainly made up for the first course. Damn this was good! \n\nThroughout the meal, my other gracious friends let me sample their lobster gnocchi and separately, the veal tortelloni. The flavors of each were intense and left me wanting to come back in the very near future to sample the rest of the menu. \n\nFor dessert, I ordered the tiramisu which is standard for me. My partner, the goat cheese cr\u00e8me br\u00fbl\u00e9e which was absolutely phenomenal. My only complaint was that I would've ordered an entire portion of that instead of my tiramisu which by the way was also very good. \n\nOverall, the entire dining experience seemed to go off without a hitch.

I was too distracted with the lovely company and the wine I was drinking. They set us up in the Carriage House with the tables arranged in a big square. What a neat idea!

Simple ingredients, but they played off of each other very nicely.  A light and refreshing interlude to my main course.\n\nGnocchi - oh yeah, what Stefanie C. said.....absolutely phenomenal.  And no, this isn't your typical store-bought gnocchi, guaranteed they were making this from scratch in the kitchen because each piece was a little bit of a different size and there were no machinery marks indicative of mass production on them at all.  Some of the best gnocchi I have ever had and I will come back for more.  The lobster and sweet corn with truffle, basil and roasted tomatoes worked perfectly for the dish, everything came together in sweet harmony.\n\nThe Grilled Lamb Chops were also something to write home about, especially that Pumpkin Gratin, WHERE did that come from??

I felt like I was eating a gross slice of cake. \n\nGreen Dragon Roll - ANOTHER DISAPPOINTMENT. The rice was warm and fell apart to the touch. The avocado was warm and mushy. The fish roe smelled weird. and there was WAY to much cucumber. \n\nRegular Sushi (12 pc) Assorted with california roll - Again the sushi fell apart to touch and the rice had a weird smell it wasn't vinegar but it smelled like the chef has been washing his hand with lemon water. Avocado was mushy and they decorated with cucumbers yet again. and the fish has weird colour. Just looking at it knew it wasn't fresh.\n\nAssorted Sashimi (12 pcs) (BEST PART OF THE NIGHT \"SARCASM\") -  It came with 3 pcs  of white tuna, 3 pcs  of tuna, 3 pcs of salmon, and 3 pcs of surf clams. The sashimi was like BLOCKS of sashimi. It was a good 1 - 2 inches thick. You would think thats worth your money but it felt GROSS going down cause it felt like I was eating a piece of  rawr fish steak. The tuna was hard to the bite, salmon was decent, white tuna was decent and surf clams were normal. but its just IT WAS SO THICK. i wished i asked for a knife cause i couldve probably eat it like a steak. T________T\" \n\nSO, that was all we ordered. At this point we were not feeling well, we paid the bill and left. I WILL NEVER COME BACK AGAIN. expecting it to be beaches area soooo rent should be a higher price i would've expected better food from them. \n\nWAIT FOR THE ENDING, WE PAID THE BILL AND LEFT AND WE WENT TO THE CONVENIENCE STORE NEARBY TO LOOK AT DRINK AND THE WAITRESS ACTUALLY RAN AFTER US. (NOT THAT WE WERE RUNNING AWAY) AND TOLD US THE BILL WAS WRONG. It was $67 or so with our $30 off she wrote $30 instead of $37. We didnt pay attention. We paid with whatever , PLUS IT WAS RAINING. but i was caught off guard with their service that the girl ran after us and also wanted more tips. \n\nthis was just the biggest disappointment i've had yet.", "business_id": "251cOqWFI9t0udLSdS6SCA", "stars": 1, "date": "2011-08-19", "useful": 4, "type": "review", "cool": 0}, {"funny": 3, "user_id": "NHwqfU8b_8cf1H05FDt9Eg", "review_id": "xeek_aBvU4koFWPYjfK-aQ", "text": "Well there's been alot of hype about this chain opening in Pittsburgh. We received some coupons in the mail for $10 off a $20 purchase. Its a pretty rad coupon. I'm apparently not the only one who thought so because both times we checked this place out, there were lines out the door. The first time we were busy and didn't have the time to sit and wait. The second time, we waited in an even longer line. It was obvious the staff was only letting so many shoppers in at a time. Even though this was obvious, every other yinzer trying to push a cart into the store demanded to know what was the matter. Still, the wait was maybe 10 minutes tops. No big deal.\n\nYou will see me comparing this store to both Walmart and to Aldi's. And unfortunately, it doesn't really measure up to either. Its prices are generally higher than Aldi's on most items. Prices are about even with Walmart, with a greater selection at Walmart. Basically, Bottom Dollar is a cross between an Aldi's and a normal grocery store. Actually its more like a regular grocery store that's just smaller and uses cartons and crates to display the items instead of traditional shelving. In all honestly, its not really like Aldi's at all.\n\nWell the first thing we noticed was the produce section. We were assuming it would be like Aldi's, where you can only by prepackaged bundles of produce at super low prices. Here, the prices are generally very low but you get to bag your own stuff. Most of the produce is in a cold room. Reading online this is because it saves on labor from having to push the produce into and out of the cooler each night. Most of the prices were about what they'd be at Walmart. Some were actually more expensive but most were probably a dime cheaper per pound.\n\nOther than that, its pretty much a normal grocery store. The prices are cheap, but they're not THAT cheap. Most of the prices are right in line with Walmart. Some are slightly more expensive and some are less so. There's no deli or bakery or anything. The only real steal I found was a 5 pound package of drumsticks for like 2 bucks. Its whats for supper tonight. Other than that, I could have gotten everything else at Walmart for the same price. Plus I could have bought some socks, condoms and a vacuum cleaner. And if you'd have stopped at Aldi's first, you'd have saved yourself probably $10-$20 on a cart of groceries. Its mostly name brand stuff, whereas Aldi's is mostly generics. The prices on the name brand stuff might be noticeably cheaper than Walmart, but I didn't notice. \n\nI really was not that impressed with Bottom Dollar. Other than the 25 drumsticks I got for $2.00 and the bunch of cilantro I got for $0.58, everything was about what I'd pay in Walmart. Plus I'd multiply my selection by 20. However, I do have three more $10 off $20 coupons. So I will at least be going three more times.", "business_id": "5IGyYjfDzOog6oO-DYmWOg", "stars": 2, "date": "2012-02-04", "useful": 4, "type": "review", "cool": 2}, {"funny": 4, "user_id": "RNIQdiN2RHamTGwdq6PXqg", "review_id": "W1ybmRIMTXp1XL2wJ5edRw", "text": "Before I got into Paper Tiger I was in desperate need for a birthday present for a friend I met whilst backpacking in SE Asia. Having had an unsatisfactory treck along and around Princes Street, Paper Tiger was my last hope. Sitting on a shelf was a hammock - boom! This was to be a reminder of our hammock time away from being 'on the road'. She liked it so much she went and bought one for her boyfriend and now they happily swing in their garden together. After that I was hooked.\n\nPaper Tiger is full of things I didn't know I needed. Every time I walk in it's with a purpose of purchasing a specific thing then something catches my eye and I spend ages browsing the shelves and half an hour has gone by which is probably the longest amount of time I spend in a shop so small. So I leave with either a bag of things or a list of 'To buy on next trip'. Also I often find myself caressing beautiful book covers (I don't have a fetish btw)  and holding things close to my chest or smiling to myself. For example I went through a phase of photographing clouds - that's right, CLOUDS - I love clouds and here they have a book on clouds. There is something for almost every age from crafty things for kids to sophisticated or novelty gadgets for adults as well as a fabulous range of informative books, greetings cards and stationery to suit different needs i.e office or wedding; and moods with fun or sexy designs. They cover useful things you could never have thought of and which are hard to find anywhere else. I particularly like the travel section and buy the miniature kits which fit in your pocket and include paper soap - paper soap! I know that if i need to buy a gift for someone I can almost always pick something up here and it is always with thought and love that means more than can always be conveyed by other shops and I'd say is more likely to be kept for life.\n\nWhat I also like about this shop is the staff are always warm and friendly, greet you on arrival and say goodbye and seem to be pretty passionate about Paper Tiger.", "business_id": "CLBhU0yc2OPoJTRRSdqN8Q", "stars": 5, "date": "2013-02-20", "useful": 4, "type": "review", "cool": 4}, {"funny": 3, "user_id": "hU46otnbSfdU5oI0zhJGoA", "review_id": "BwGmCxdO-QTT710fsnwYww", "text": "If you gamble & you're interested in ACTUALLY WINNING... and you're willing to use your brain a little... or maybe you're already an experienced player... this store is almost a mandatory stop.  Not quite but certain worth frequenting.\n\nThis isn't just a bookstore, folks.  I'm really, really surprised that there aren't more reviews for this place.  I suppose Yelp is more of a foodie's review site... but the Gambler's Book Shop is the most famous bookstore in Las Vegas.  I would have thought more people would have visited and reviewed!  I've visited a few times... and I ordered through their online store otherwise. \n\nSo why wouldn't you just order the same books from Amazon?\n\n1) \"OUT-OF-PRINT\" BOOKS\nBesides having all the ol' standbys, like Doyle Brunson's Super System or Don Schlesinger's Blackjack Attack, Gambler's Bookstore often has books that you won't find listed on Amazon.  Stuff that's drifted out of print, stuff that's hidden on the shelves, stuff that you'd never otherwise know about.  It's there.\n...Example:  While you're there, ask if you can see a copy of \"Beyond Counting\", by James Grosjean - a book which had only 500 copies ever printed of it, but it's legendary and sells on eBay for $500/copy.  Yeah... get the picture, now?\n\n2) OTHER PATRONS\nThis can be fun.  Depending on who's there you might be able to eavesdrop on some interesting conversations.  Smart gamblers from all over the world congregate here to thumb through the shelves or just to chat.  You might even get some good advice from of a few of them that know a thing or two.  \n...Who knows?  If you're really lucky, you might even bump into some of the more famous folk like members of the Blackjack Hall of Fame.  Maybe a WSOP finalist.  Or maybe even some of the authors themselves!\n\n3) HISTORY\nThe bookstore used to be a club actually and has a long and storied history of where it came from and why it is what it is.  It's been around since before the \"new Las Vegas\" (born of the 'Mirage') was created and it'll probably still be here after the \"de-themed\" Las Vegas takes hold with CityCenter, Echelon, Fountainbleu, etc.\n...if you want to see a piece of history while maybe hearing a tale or two, this is a good place to visit.\n\nWeb site:  http://www.gamblersbook.com \n\nCONCLUSION:\nSpecific to the gambler, the Gambler's Book Shop is a place of legend in Vegas and a must-visit for anyone looking to \"bring down the house\".\n\n4-stars.\n\n(I can't give it the golden 5-star-stamp of approval because it's not an \"absolute-must-visit-every-trip\" locale however it's certainly great enough to visit & revisit every so often)\n\n--------------------\nINSIDER'S TIP:  \"The Fourth Reason to Visit the Gambler's Book Shop\"\n4)  HOWARD\nHoward Schwartz is the shop proprietor and the ORIGINAL FOUNDER of the Gambler's Book Shop.

Usually we have no problem refusing an offer like this, but the lure of a little massage preview and a room full of cute Asian people was too great an offer to refuse. We both sat down and let them go at it. They immediately dug into our shoulders in a way that hurt a little but felt good at the same time and kept asking, \"You lie, you lie?\" We said, \"Yes, we like, we like!\" and before I knew it, I was face down on a table with a little Asian man massaging my whole body. I'm not sure what, if any, technical training these massage therapists have, (if you can even call them that), but whatever they learned from the home country, they learned well! I left feeling so relaxed (just like the name of the joint) and the ache in my lower back was gone as soon as I left. We were so impressed that we went back the next weekend and decided to each get a foot massage. As they pounded and prodded and tickled and tugged on our feet, while we reclined in a big leather chair we couldn't help but think, \"This is the life\".

So, I decided to stay and order food. Being the exotic food eater that I am, I decided to order the crab cakes with chipolte mayo on a bed of coleslaw and forcancia bread. When Sarah brought out the food it looked fine, smelled great, and tasted delicious too. I ate those crab cakes voraciously while Sarah entertained me with a story. \n\nAfter that, I had one more drink and paid my tab, since it was getting late. 10pm to be exact.

IVP stands for Italian Village Pizza and is part of the ever-present local chain (there are 18 locations in the Pittsburgh area alone). Considering that we were feeling lethargic after a trying week and that the IVP in Pleasant Hills was where we lunched on our first date almost 3 years ago, Kay and I decided roll the 20 sided die anticipating a surefire nostalgia-tinted hit. \n\nA coupon in said pamphlet on a payday weekend caused us to over-order. We \"treated\" ourselves to a Bacon Cheeseburger with Onion Rings and French Fries, A medium pizza featuring the Kay Kombo, a dozen wings, and a whole Steak & Bacon Pizza. \n\nI enjoyed IVP's pie when I dined in one with Kay, but something was definitely lost in transit. The pizza itself was  gummy, plaster-flavored, and laden with a catsup-ish sauce that might as well have been invisible. \n\nThe burger was cooked into pure jejuneness. I suppose a \"nothing less than well-done\" policy must be enforced by IVP's headquarters. The french fries tasted like mashed potatoes encased in gelatin. \n\nThe wings were halfway acceptable as was the Zeppoli (fried dough). The hoagie smacked of Steakumms and frozen bacon strips, however. \n\nDelivery took close to an hour. Just as I was about to make a phone call to the parlor, a miniature beater pulled up onto our sidewalk. \n\nMethinks there's a few too many IVP's around. Bump this one off so that the others can breathe a bit easier. With so many other pizza purveyors dishing out superior pies in the neighborhood, it's not as if South Side needs IVP anyway. \n\nP.S.

You will instantly pay $1-2 less at the Club Palms price compared to their regular price. What's a $buck?  If you have any previous experience ordering dim sum, then you know these dollar savings add up quickly and can be used instead for tipping the waitstaff or funding your quest to accumulate enough slot points to redeem for a Palms shot glass.\n\nWith that said here is my unusually more succinct review based on my observations from my 2 recent visits to Fortunes.  In general, Chinese speaking customers definitely receive slightly better service from the Chinese Fortunes staff, I am hypothesizing that it is partially due to their English language skill.  When I heard them speak in Chinese they sound friendly, but when the same staff speak to English speaking customers it does not come across as nicely and could be interpreted as brusque.  Just an observation like I said.\n\nSo what about their dim sum?  Before Fortunes, this spot was called Cathy House, which also had a dim sum offering, which was pretty good for Vegas standards.  I am not sure what happened and why the name change, and definitely not at all privy to the employment status of the chefs and cooks that worked there before and after the name change. What I do know is that the dim sum menu may still look similar, but the overall quality has gone down the proverbial drain.\n\nThe only item I ordered that I still considered good was their Pork & Shrimp Shu Mai.  Their Steamed Pork Rib Black Bean and Stuffed Bean Curd Skin with Pork & Shrimp were both just okay.  Baked Egg Yolk Cream Bun, used to be great here, but now I will avoid this greasy over-baked dessert pastry with very miniscule filling. But the other usual dim sum staples such as Shrimp Steamed Rice Roll (worst I have ever had in 3 different continents where I have had dim sum) and Crystal Shrimp Dumpling were really bad.  It felt like the items were not fresh and was reheated from the previous day's left over batch and/or the \"wrapper\" was made poorly, contributing to the odd rough texture (it should be silkier than what I had).  Needless to say, I will not be back for dim sum here until the overall quality has improved.  Not to mention that in spite of the relative dearth of dim sum restaurants here in Las Vegas, there are still better dim sum alternatives within reasonable driving distance.\n\nAside from dim sum (main menu available until 3pm only, after that you have to be content with just 6 items on their limited menu) they serve up a typical Chinese restaurant menu offering with 3 different pho (Vietnamese noodle soup). As I have never tried this portion of their menu, it will not factor into my review.  But the restaurant does have some enticing daily specials that may be worth checking out (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/fortunes-las-vegas-2?select=L1swxxmabddvxirB3ee-sw#GSABGYz6StpwDQbG0EOCdQ).\n\nAs food quality and taste is the most important factors in my review, I sadly have to only give this current incarnation of the dim sum restaurant inside the Palms a 1 star review.  The service is okay, and definitely have room for improvement.  But if you are trying to attract Asian gamblers and comping them with dim sum (which I am sure they are very well aware of and come with certain expectations of minimum standard for quality and taste), then this marketing ploy is deeply flawed and in much need of revamping.\n\n1 star only.

You would think Curry Leaf was trying to present itself as an upscale Indian food restaurant in a hugely desirable area. \n\nCurry Leaf shares a strip mall with a dry cleaners, taco bell, AZ Hair Co and Chuck E Cheese. It's a small place with tables to eat in, but I imagine most of their business is takeout or the newly available delivery. \n\nJeff P mentions \"It just sees as if some random Auntie and Uncle decided to lease a space and start cooking fast food versions of Indian food\" ... first of all, I disagree with this, and second, isn't America founded on the entrepreneurial spirit that promotes local owned businesses?!? \n\nCurry Leaf is owned by a husband/wife duo and I was super stoked at how nice the husband was. He answered my questions without prejudice which is rare for me in other Indian establishments. While I waited for my food, we chatted about their business, my business and other random chit chat. As I was leaving, another gentleman came in and the husband sang out \"Hey Bob, how are you doing today?!?\" It's nice to see that customer service and appreciation are still alive these days. \n\nI ordered the Channa Masala bowl with Basmati Rice and a side of Cumin Potatoes and I was really impressed. The flavor in both dishes was great and had just a little tinge of spicyness. The portions were great and for the price of $4.99 I think an excellent value (Lunch price is $4.99; regularly $6.99). \n\nThere are also a couple of really neat things that make this place stand out: They offer deliver and TEXT IN service... so you can actually text them your order for pickup! I think that is such a cool idea. You are texting directly to the husbands phone, and then he saves your number so that in the future he knows that its you. I'm pretty sure he remembers every customer. \n\nThe bowls that they use for takeout are very durable and can be used again as Tupperware. I think this is a super cool idea and adds a little value. \n\nIn a world where we are cattle prodded through life eating out of Styrofoam containers in our cars, I believe Curry Leaf has made an attempt to add value to their product and I for one am both impressed and inspired and look forward to a new weekly lunch spot!", "business_id": "IaJ8ZCKxKFzgNoIFNCc0YQ", "stars": 5, "date": "2009-03-11", "useful": 10, "type": "review", "cool": 12}, {"funny": 5, "user_id": "gAmmEZLSdj5KXvOlPUQRfQ", "review_id": "1bv1RXIWPWaW4RA3kjbpUA", "text": "Here is what I wrote to their corporate office after a horrible experience with the store manager.

I have returned items to the store without tags before with no problem. I asked if she was the \nmanager, and she said yes.\n\nShe then said she would be able to do it just this one time for me. But \nthen she changed her mind and she could only return one item for me. She then tells me to \"calm down and not make a scene\", which is ridiculous since I was not yelling or making a scene of any kind. I am not the kind to do any sort of thing, but her saying that made me even more upset. She says that I need to find the tags and come back on a day that she's working so that she can ask her supervisor if she can do this for me.\n\nI have never been treated so rudely at any Banana Republic store, \nnevertheless, ANY retail store.

A few other menu items are posted on the walls.\n\nI got the Curry Rice \"curry sauce with vegetables and beef over rice\" for $7.95, which came with miso soup and a side salad.  The soup and salad arrived first, the soup was heavy with seaweed while the salad was shredded cabbage with a tangy vinaigrette.  When my curry rice arrived, I looked at my meal with disappointment.  It was an average amount, and the vegetables were only carrots and onions.  On top of the rice there was pickled ginger.  As I started to scoop out the sauce and rice onto another plate, I noticed there was no beef present.  I swam my spoon throughout the sauce and there was no beef to be found!  I double checked the menu to be sure it said beef and it did, so I waved the waiter over.  I asked if there was supposed to be beef in my dish and he nodded, and apologized and headed to the cook.  When he returned, I was afraid to see what he held in the small soy sauce dish.  Four pieces of cubed beef in curry sauce was what he placed in front of me, and that was just very sad indeed.  Sad for the beef being completely absent in my dish, and sad because of the sorry four pieces of beef cubes he then gave me.  In regards to taste, the curry sauce was fine, nothing special and not worth the price.\n\nThe Big F ordered the Cha-Shu Ramen \"soy based soup with EXTRA roasted pork\" for $9.25.

For more information about how you can get involved, visit St. Mary's website: www.firstfoodbank.org\n\nThank you CM, Hailey B., for getting Team Yelper together and thank you to all the hard working people at St. Mary's Food Bank that do the very important work that provides to so many families in the community.", "business_id": "4_c1hHAx2BDX6zbWv7XFYg", "stars": 5, "date": "2016-09-23", "useful": 19, "type": "review", "cool": 20}, {"funny": 3, "user_id": "6gNUzn0lnSgbVyLFm_3Mrg", "review_id": "pMh0dpCpoGZo8PksZDg3Vg", "text": "Being the VIP WE ARE!!!!! 4-6pm hot food served on Fri & Sat!\n\nAlways great service with a :)\n\nDiamond players get + 1 \n\n7 stars get + 3 I think....\n\nJust make sure u tip generously...", "business_id": "-g_3XHnCdchIchtC-le2tQ", "stars": 5, "date": "2013-09-20", "useful": 2, "type": "review", "cool": 3}, {"funny": 3, "user_id": "GbnbFgJ1tKHJpGQO_lrOEg", "review_id": "Muy7TXL3ODpwA5DE5PyXLg", "text": "Ah, where to begin. I'll start with the good.\n\nMy brandy old-fashioned was great. My waitress was both competent and pleasant, which isn't all that common these days. Advice to her: leave. You can do better than this hole. Now that I've covered the high points, I will move on to the real review.\n\nQueen Anne's is an old catering/banquet hall that has seen better days. However, the better days here were likely long before the better days at other places. Yikes. The ambiance is best described as institutional, combining the worst parts of a caterer and a hospice. The decor is so tired it is exhausted, with old-school metal stacking chairs and widely spaced tables. Industrial grade carpeting covers the floor.  At the entrance to the dining room stands a plastic folding table upon which a cash register stands. \n\nAs for staff, it's bad. There is no apparent management. Most of the employees are pushing their so-called uniform requirements to the edge. Ties barely knotted, studded metal belts with dress pants, rolled sleeves revealing poor tattoos and men with 3 days of stubble. There is a live pianist who is both bad and has apparently not updated his headshot displayed on the postboard since 1986. At least the bartender and my waitress were well presented and pleasant.\n\nFood was miserable. The basket or rolls and cheddar-chive biscuits (I'm fairly certain about the flavoring, but who really knows?) were dry and crumbly. Cole slaw was chipped rather than shredded and overdressed to boot; it was positively swimming in a watery, mayo-based dressing. The baked beans served were a strange and under-cooked mix of navy, great northern, and either small red or large black beans. Their sauce was fair in quality (at best) and rummy in flavor. Pass.\n\nAs for the main course, the fish was square -- literally. That's a bad sign. Cooking quality was mediocre and  flavor only fair.   Tartar sauce was food service quality and likely came from a tub sold at Costco. I had opted for \"Roastys\" potatoes and should have known better upon sighting the misspelling. Instead of a good Swiss roesti of crisp potatoes, fine shredded onion, butter, and Emmental cheese, I received a soggy mess of potato with coarse chopped onion and oily cheddar. It tasted surprisingly decent despite the appearance; still, it remains an indictment of their culinary skills and/or staff. I seriously doubt there is anyone directing quality and I'm probably the closest thing to a chef that has graced this place's presence in the last 20 years.\n\nThe last straw was when I got up to use the restroom and left my bill, my jacket, a notepad,  and my cocktail at the table. I returned in time to see my place being cleared and my waitress trying to stop the busser from clearing my place, including my still more than half-full drink. What the hell, man? All my things are there and it's obvious I wasn't done. My waitress offered to replace it, but I did not want to be there anymore. I mentioned it to the guy (manager?) who was manning the cash register when I brought up my bill and got neither an apology nor an offer to take it off my bill. What a crock.\n\nQueen Anne's is a complete waste of not-very-valuable real estate on the west side. If you want a good fish fry, stay away. If you want a mediocre fish fry, stay away. I you want a poor fish fry, stay away. If you want an actively bad fish fry, this may be your place...but I'm guessing you'll still leave disappointed.", "business_id": "5yvu4wRi61NNBctafro1Pw", "stars": 1, "date": "2012-04-17", "useful": 0, "type": "review", "cool": 1}, {"funny": 3, "user_id": "QuZbJquRtbY9O9JrB9NpxQ", "review_id": "VDxvv2GWzL_4Gx4TLY_RHQ", "text": "I don't know if I hit Ocean on an off night or what but I won't be back after my one experience here.\n\nI'm not a fan of this style of restaurant to begin with and I found the food to vary from average to poor.\n\nI've never had what I would consider good food at a Chinese buffet and have not eaten at one for years.

Elena, the hygienist, freaked out on me and stopped working mid-way. I ended my cleaning appointment with an incomplete work!\n\nI was stunned and at a loss of words. Her behaviour was unprofessional, and the only thing she accomplished was to deepen my sense of stigmatization and increase my trauma and fear of going to the dentist.\n\nI used to go to Dr. Wong in Vancouver and he was amazing.  When he brought in a new dentist, she was even better, hard to believe! Their bedside manner and calm demeanor helped soothe the fear I have.  She would talk to me throughout the entire cleaning and I was distracted enough by her stories to forget the scraping. Plus, they have a tv in each room.\n\nBack to Queen St Dental Care. No tvs.  I am placed in a sterile, beige room where there is no caltron (the electronic device)!  I need to have both the caltron and manual tool to get the dental cleaning job done!  \n\nThe way Elena works makes it very slow and painful.  I panicked from the constant scraping in my teeth because it was prolonged.\n\nThey have no understanding of what a nervous patient is, and thanks to her unprofessional attitude, my fear, which has increased since going to the, is now cemented. She turned around and put the blame on me- making me feel like I did something wrong (by panicking) - by stating how much she was shaking, without acknowledging that I was afraid. \n\nMy first dentist was a younger lady who was very frigid, with little bedside manner.  She left to become a body builder (or was it aerobics competitor?). First big red flag that the people working there do not have the vocation.\n\nI am very disappointed and am only returning to get the dental cleaning completed.

It's super cute (read: there's not many tables), it's got a sassy menu (they make bold statements. I dig that), and they slap their eggs benny on top of cheese biscuits. That to me is an instant winner, although upon further inspection, I don't love the combination as much as I thought I would. Did it once, enjoyed it at a 75% success rating and then moved on to something amazing-er: eggs poached in salsa with avocado and cilantro, served with tortilla chips. Now we're talking.\n\nThere are other things on the menu I've always wanted to try, but I haven't been able to move on from the salsa eggs. One day my gaping maw will inhale the homemade granola or the french toast prepared with croissants dipped in vanilla bean batter (does that still exist?); maybe I'll even try one of the daily specials. \n\nIt should be noted that the pancakes taste like vanilla cupcakes, and you may be tempted to buy a baked good sitting pretty in the display as you leave.
