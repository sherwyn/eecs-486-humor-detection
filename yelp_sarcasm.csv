Its okay, I guess. The only positive thing about this McDonalds is that the managers are no-nonsense crazy women. The employees generally stick around for a long time, I havent seen a huge shift in the folks working here for the past 6-12 months. Kind of friendly and neighborhoodly...ya know?

The other good thing is the lines. There are really no lines, but rather a crowd. So you just push past people to the front. Something the tourists arent used to, but gives the lokes an advantage.

4 piece nugget is like 1.25 - better deal than the 10 piece for 3 something.",,,,,

The vibe is sort of Longman and Eagle meets Citgo meets run-down but efficient amusement park ride, but the food is outstanding! I think they put dopamine directly in the fries, because after you've had them once, you just smell them in your dreams. Reasonable prices too. Oh, and they have something called a ""Happy Meal,"" which is miniature food AND A COOL TOY!!!! What? Crazy! Try the nuggets.",,,,,

This particular Mcdonalds has a cast of interesting characters to keep one entertained over a Big Mac lunch. I once educated some homeless drunks about transsexuals and it was a very unique experience. Occasional fights break out, but the staff is good about keeping out the ruffians. 
The best part of this Mcdonalds is that it has a restroom that is fully open to the public, and while it's not the cleanest, it's probably the best around. It's also open til midnight!",,,,,
