I was very much looking forward to going to Modern on Melrose as my sister had raved about the selection and several purchases she recently made here. I was all set to help her select more furniture for her new home until I experienced a combination of disbelief, shock and horror. \n\nI was inside the store when I heard a man loudly say \"If you're going to start a sale, finish it!\" It took a few more seconds of loud voices before I realized an argument was taking place between two employees and not two customers, as I initially thought. The male and female employee continued to loudly argue, back and forth. Feeling very uncomfortable, I started to look for my sister. There were about four other customers and we all ended up outside as we all felt very uncomfortable in the store. \n\nAs I was walking out of the store to go out back, I heard the male employee say, in a tone that was beyond anger but instead violent, \"Don't you ever tell me to shut up! Ever!\" Shortly after, he walked past all 5 female customers, who had gathered out back, turned to us and angrily said \"Bitch!\" Not knowing what he was going to do when he returned, we decided to leave as we did not feel safe. \n\nIt is one thing to feel uncomfortable, it is completely unacceptable to not feel safe. The interaction between the two employees was the most unprofessional thing I have ever witnessed. The male and female employee were so caught up in their own negative interaction, neither of them offered any customer service. And after their argument ended, the female employee offered no apologies and still no customer service. \n\nToday was my first and last time in Modern on Melrose. How terribly sad for this store. I sincerely hope the owners get a handle on this and educate their employees as to what it and isn't acceptable behavior.", "business_id": "2LfIuF3_sX6uwe-IR-P0jQ", "stars": 1, "date": "2013-11-17", "useful": 4, "type": "review", "cool": 2}, {"funny": 5, "user_id": "B7ecAeAIrXg7sgmabS38pg", "review_id": "RAzbLYbgw3tNv8Tu0R7qmQ", "text": "Hmmm, what to say about Mint.\n\nOkay, if you are a girl and looking for clothes here, I'd say pass.

Ended up backtracking through Brecksville and I remembered an old friend. London Pickle Works! Was it still there some four years after I stopped in while house shopping? Yup. Incidentally, investing in a condo down there probably would have made more sense than buying a house in Lakewood. Live and learn.\n\nCozied up to the bar and ordered a Killians, plus cheesesteak to go(for pooch). Like the Unicorn, food was amazingly done before I could chug my brew. I could get used to this kind of service. The bar was all old men. Matt, I don't know how you do it. They were watching Fox news for chrissakes!! Total was eight dollars! Holy shit. I dropped a three dollar tip on that barmaid's ass. How could I not? A real meal at fast food prices, at fast food speed, served by someone not under house arrest with work privileges. Busted open the styro box. Big sandwich with mushrooms, onions, cheez and beef sliced so thin I swear it was a Steak'um. I never ate those as a kid, but I remember one time my friend had one in his bedroom where we were playing NES. He didn't want it, so we threw it all around the room. Fries were awesome. Also got a pickle. That's eight dollars with the beer, just to recap. Great value, nice location, old men.

Am I missing some sort of cultural significance here? \n\nThe place is dark with small tables, chairs and booths.  It took them ten minutes to hand us the menus after being seated which I thought was incredibly appalling because I'm sure they didn't forget about us.  They have candles on the tables which made it kinda uncomfortable because it seemed too romantic for our own goods (We were hungry and randomly walked into this place).  I ain't gonna lie, the food was good!  We ordered some noodles which tasted like mixed flavors of Chinese and Italian.  Surprise, surprise, it came in a tiny portion that can easily be confused as an appetizer.  WTF mang.  There were just too many selections on the menu (sarcasm) so I ordered an eye roll.  For more than a dub, it's not worth it.  But compared to other rolls I've had at other sushi places, this roll melted in my mouth with just the right amount of flavor, MmmM.

I enjoy watching the Sunday night football game here and enjoying a drink or two.  Last night I decided to grab a bite to eat.\n\nI was dining by myself and wanted some finger food.  After browsing the menu for a few minutes, I decided to go with the Nachos ($10.50).  To wash it down, I had an Iced Tea.\n\nI watched the Giants/Bears game while I waited for my grub......it didn't take too long before it came....the waitress delivered the Nachos and they were a friggin' mountain of Nachos!  (see pics) Seriously.....I'm not opposed to large portions, but damn this thing could easily feed 4 people!  I was a little pissed because I didn't want to eat that much and the waitress didn't say anything.....also the menu didn't mention the gargantuan size of the Nachos either.  I reacted by saying \"Damn, that's a friggin' mountain of food!\".....she replied \"I know\"......well if you knew, why didn't you say something when I ordered it?!\n\nThis is where I am torn....do I knock off a Star because of this?  or not?  I personally feel that it's the server's responsibility to inform customers of stuff like this....especially when they see someone is dining alone and portion size is not mentioned on the menu.\n\nBack to the food....the Nachos were topped with melted Cheddar Cheese, Jalapenos, Guacamole, Sour Cream, Onions, Olives, Tomatoes.  The thing was so massive that stuff was falling off the edges of plate....another faux pas from the server is that she didn't offer me a smaller plate to eat my Nachos.....she expected me to pull pieces off this mountain and have it fall all over the table like a pig.  I tried for a few minutes but felt like a slob so I asked her for a plate, which she brought over right away.\n\nThe Nachos flavor wasn't spectacular, it was bleh.  The Cheese wasn't gooey....it was melted, but seemed to be sitting a little while because it was already coagulating and it was difficult to eat the Nachos without using a fork.  Also, it was top heavy with the toppings....meaning after the 1st layer of Nachos, there was nothing but bare chips in the lower sections.  What's the point of this dish then?  I don't know.....I felt bad because I didn't even come close to finishing it and it wasn't worth taking home......what a waste of food.\n\nI took off 1 Star because of the bad service.....still a great place to catch a game.  I've eaten here many times in the past with great experiences, but was an inactive Yelper at the time so those experiences are outdated.\n\nWill I return?  Because of my favorable history with Big Dog's, I will give them another chance.....next time I'm asking the server how large the portion is.", "business_id": "1Lbq92b6B9z1FYk5mS2R9Q", "stars": 2, "date": "2010-10-04", "useful": 10, "type": "review", "cool": 6}, {"funny": 4, "user_id": "pMefTWo6gMdx8WhYSA2u3w", "review_id": "EiiK6ayw26wEOb3bF8scqw", "text": "Seeing as there are reviews for Dine on L3 (Yorkdale mall) and Urban Eatery (Eaton Centre), I figure I would review the new food court in Square One which is going by the name of \"Food Central\".

I came here because my dearest friend told me to so I did!  I had snooped on their website and blog the week before so I knew I *had* to try the Ferrero cookie on top of some other goods.  Between the two of us, we had a cookie, a lemon bar that was recommended by the friendly barista with the cool hair, a macchiato, and an iced tea.  \n\nThe first sip of the espresso sent me straight onto Cloud 9.  It was rich, fragrant, and creamy.  It made Addiction stir and I was hooked by that vixen.  Girl, I will never give you up again.  The iced tea helped clean the palate as well as that super tasty and tart lemon bar.  Could this be fresh lemon juice?  If it was concentrate, it fooled me.  As for the Ferrero cookie, it was everything I imagined it would be and more.  It was crispy on the edges and soft and delicious in the middle.  Nutella and a very generous amount of hazelnuts decorated the top.  It got a tad too sweet with the ample amount of hazelnut spread but I imagine it being perfect with a foamy latte.  I wish they drew a tiny leaf in my espresso...\n\nThe coffee shop itself is very hipster industrial chic --- wood, steal, a bike, a marquee arrow, a mattress sans the cover and fluff, and glass bottles as lighting. It was very cool.  I like the concrete floors and all the reclaimed wood.  I could imagine a young Joyce sitting here with all her other art student friends, the WP Carey business majors working on their stuffy group assignments on the leather couch and arm chairs, and the regular Tempe resident grabbing a cuppa before work.

Apparently, these were being tested for an upcoming breakfast offering.\n\nI liked the cold brew tasting-- four cold brews of your choosing, for $6.  You then get to choose a 12 oz. pour of cold brew, or opt for any pastry/dessert from the case.  I chose Ethiopian, Apple Jack, Blackberry-Lavender, and Coconut.  Funny how the two I thought I'd enjoy the most (the last two) would be my least favorites!  I'd definitely order the Ethiopian cold brew again, and perhaps the Apple Jack with cream.  The blackberry-lavender was too tart, and I could only detect the berry, which was unfortunate, since I love lavender-scented anything: chocolates/truffles, ice creams/gelatos, shortbreads, soaps, and lotions, etc.  The house-made tiramisu was just OK.  Actually, I didn't eat much of it at the time, since I already had enough milk fat and sugar from the salted creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e coffee here, and I ended up throwing away the leftovers at home that night, since most of the takeaway cup was filled with waxy cream filling.

(Less traffic, not as many obnoxious tourists, etc.)  Also the biggest selling point for me is your proximity to your car.   (you are definitely going to want to rent a car if you stay here, in my opinion)  I absolutely hate the self parking rigamaroo  and subsequent trek through throngs of casino-goers and  miles a dreary, carpeted passageways just to get to your room that is the norm at most of the big hotels.   here you just open your car door and step inside.   it's an old TravelLodge,  so you get the idea of the setup.\n\nSince it is a gay-owned and operated business, there are a few feel-good points awarded for staying here, and supporting the community.   stuff is generally very nice and the owner is attentive, and seems to get what people want.\n\nThere is a nice breakfast spread in the morning including  2-hour coffee, which is a bonus.\n\nThere is a steam room and  kind of seedy  porn watching area,  if you're into that.\n\nCONS:   \n\nDon't go there expecting to meet a porn star.   I'm sure it happens, but this isn't the cast's quarters for Chippendale's, lol.  \n\nIf you want to have guests at the hotel, you sort of have to go  down and let them in at night.   not a big deal, and it makes sense from a security standpoint, but is not as freewheeling as some other places.\n\nIf you are used to staying at the Bellagio,  and need to park next to a Bentley  to get yourself through the day,  skip this place.   as I said, it is campy and fun,  not glamorous or chic.   but at the end of the day, ask yourself... what is Vegas really all about?", "business_id": "8KWWHywMjN-154i_Qi0deQ", "stars": 4, "date": "2010-01-14", "useful": 8, "type": "review", "cool": 4}, {"funny": 3, "user_id": "QQoZeJszS2mWhMRcs5og4Q", "review_id": "GjcERxzREIVo7YIDkTqgHA", "text": "If you are looking for an all men's gay hotel in Vegas, this is your one option and it falls into that tough category of:  because it's gay, we'll stay there to be with our people.  So, we did.  Our first time.  Thankfully, we paid the Sunday night rate and we got that value.  The place as a whole is a little rough around the edges.  Other guests we talked to love the place and return.  We probably wouldn't.  It's the little things: no luggage rack for suitcase, no towel bars for bath towels (install a couple of hooks?), exposed wires on the walls (and extra bunched on the floor) for accent lighting, a foaming soap dispenser at sink and shower (really?  like a truck stop? I'm all for conserving on little bottles and soap bars - install a three-way liquid soap dispenser and that way you can also offer your guests shampoo and conditioner - which they don't now.  $16).  The back stairs that lead to the pool over look areas of junk.  Trash by the pool equipment etc.  So easy to just throw that stuff away.  It's in plain sight of guests and just adds to the attitude of general lack of care.  So, picky?  Well, maybe.  But, these very simple little things are what sets apart hotels and makes for a guest wanting to return.\n\nNow, the good stuff:  the Sunday pool party was very busy and fun.  Maybe 40 men (mostly au natural) sunning and frolicking.  Guests seemed to have a great time (bring your own cooler).  Breakfast was really excellent (a big pleasant surprise!).  Bed very comfortable and linens all nicely clean.  Very friendly and helpful staff.  Free WiFi worked well in the rooms.  Large steam room was nice.  Video room was popular.  And, with the day pass system, you get to mingle with some local boys, too.\n\nSo, for the gay boys who like to roll with the boys, have a great time!  We'll pass next time.

If they had truly thought out their expansion, they would have branched out a while ago and made an \"arts district\" a \"shopping district\" etc.  As it its now, they have no idea what it's supposed to be, but they slapped the \"Mill Avenue District\" name on it to give people the feeling they're living in a real city.\n\nMill's real problem now is that the buildings are too expensive for anyone not representing a giant company to afford.

Of course, nobody carries change nowadays, so I followed the blue sign that read \"Public Parking\" and wound up in the virtually empty parking garage. I spent less than an hour on the street, and when I was leaving the business I'd come to visit, I asked about having my parking pass validated. \"We don't do that any more,\" I was told. \"They took our equipment. Anyway, the first hour's free.\" Back at the parking garage, I was surprised when the attendant in the booth, without a word of greeting, said flatly, \"Two dollar.\" \"Two dollars?\" I asked him, explaining that the first hour was free, at least according to a business owner on the street. \"Two dollar,\" he said again. I had no cash, and told him so. \"Two dollar. Two dollar,\" said the parrot in his little cage. I asked him where I could get cash on the street and he said, exasperated, \"Is two dollar!\"\n\nI backed up (unsurprisingly there was nobody behind me), parked, and, already running late for an appointment, walked to the kiosk at Bank of America, was asked for spare change by a kid lounging on the sidewalk, crossed the street, re-entered the parking garage, drove up to the booth, and again presented my parking pass to the attendant, who now said, without irony, \"Three dollar.\" Evidently it cost another dollar to walk across the street to pay the already extortionate sum of two dollars. Wordlessly I handed him a twenty and, ignoring the faint smile on his lips, left Mill Avenue, this time for good. \n\nThe last time I visited Mill (more than a year ago), I received a $40 parking ticket after having lingered too long in Borders -- another business that I see has pulled up stakes and fled for a more profitable street.

Yesterday the street was virtually abandoned, the storefronts mostly empty, the few people I encountered seemingly killing time between classes at ASU. In short, it was devoid of life. And for this they charge to park? For this they make things as difficult as possible, both for visitors and for the businesses nobody wants to visit anymore? And why would they, when they can visit the same chain stores selling the same items in any mall in America?

DH, who loves carrot cake and could eat a whole sheet by himself could barely swallow a bite.

YUCK.  I split a piece with DD on her insistence.  I ate two bites.  I have to admit I am no pie connoisseur, but this was NOT good.  It was too-sweet, canned cherries in a tasteless crust.  Every cherry pie I have had before has had tart cherries.  I don't know how they got these that sweet, but it was just disgusting.

There were items hand-written into the menu, the elderly waitress made a comment that the \"chef\" was new, and the register was brand new to the waitress as well. \n\nSo, anyhow, the story:\nTwo adults and one child (age of 5). Empty diner except one elderly gentleman who showed up while we were there. The establishment was dirty....don't care. I actually expected it and may have been disappointed had it not been. The waitress needs to retire. She seemed to be struggling stringing sentences together a little. Still, not a big deal. \n\nLet's order!\n\nSo the child of our bunch ordered the spaghetti and meatballs, the adults meals were roast beef and mashed potatoes and gravy as well as swedish meatballs over noodles. \n\nEach meal came with the soup of the day (a creamy spinach soup with whatever those noodles are in wedding soup). I ordered the chili on top of that just to have a taste. The chili was GROSS! Not like a gross like this is too sweet, or too salty, or just not a good recipe....it was GROSS in a way that can only be described as it seemed as though it was so old and re-used or SOMETHING that it developed a taste of nothing with the consistency of cream of wheat. \n\nThe soup of the day came out.....again.....GROSS!!!! Gross for the same reasons except this also had the added pleasure of tasting like they \"of the dayified\" the soup pot by adding a block of salt. VERY gross. I eat EVERYTHING no matter what. I dd NOT eat this.\n\nSpaghetti comes out. Giant portion for a kid but one can't complain about that. Sad-looking but no bog whoop. She enjoyed it.....she's 5. \n\nThe roast beef and mashed potatoes come out. Immediately I see those scooped, starchy, obviously flake potatoes.....no big whoop. Not my cup of tea but they can;t be that bad. The roast beef, however, looked (and I tasted it) and tasted HORRIBLE! It had a gray tinge to it, had the appearance of a texture closer to pencil shavings (only larger) and there was literally zero moisture left in it at all. Gross but let's press on.\n\nWhile that was going on, I heard the waitress speak to the \"chef\" and explained that the Swedish Meatballs over noodles uses egg noodles and not spaghetti noodles and moreover (she didn't use that word I assure you) the \"sauce\" is a brown gravy and not marinara sauce. There was some kind of muttering of acknowledgement and the waitress let me know that there was a problem and that my meal would be out shortly. \n\nThe \"chef\" tried to give me the exact same thing the child across from me had and call it \"Swedish Meatballs Over Noodles\"!!!! Wrap your brain around that! So, after a brief lapse, the plate comes out....unbeknownst to me half my plate had spilled onto the counter during transport and the waitress had used a couple spools to get it back onto my plate before giving it to me. MMMMMMMMM!!!!! Then I look down. It's the same meatballs sitting across from me, the same spaghetti noodles (not egg noodles) sitting across from me with the same brown gravy sitting across from me.....ok, I'm not a debutante...I'll tough it out. \n\nI sliced into the first meatball. I took a bite. It was nearly frozen in the center had a salty briny taste from the gravy that also seemed spoiled. It was gross. The very first time in my years I just pushed a plate away and refused to eat it. \n\nThe waitress came over shortly after and asked how everything was. I let her know that I will kindly pay for these meals but would not feed these things to a stray dog. I let her know this was the first time I ever said this dining out. \n\nShe asked if she could take something off the check? First off, the right thing to do is to just apologize and comp the meal....I wasn't about to debate what should be taken off, get into a mathematics quiz with someone who seems confused that she is even working at a restaurant (again, no offense but she just needs to stop). \nSo we all got up and walked toward the register. This is how we found out that the register is new......\nSo I was charged a little over 20 bucks. I handed the waitress 2-20s and asked if I could just have a 10 back. This was a problem. She could figure out how to open the drawer or use it in any way. She talked to it in disdain and was even starting to have that same kind of demeanor Kathy Bates had in Misery.

Prices are fair and they state that they have lunch specials every day including Saturday and Sunday.\n\nBut, the sides sucked! I ended up not getting anything on the side.   All they had was redskin potato salad and NO mased potatos.  Also, they had 2 kinds of beans and coleslaw...and that was it.  I was kinda dissapointed.  No mashed potatos?  No corn?  ugh!  none!  \n\nOk, and I admit, Im not Martha Stewart (I know you thought I was, but I'm clearing the air on this once and for all that I'm not) but the place looks like it was decorated by a pothead!  Full fledged pothead! Its like cheba hut meets BBQ in this joint!  (no pun intended!)  WTF gives?  I've never been to a BBQ place and seen a life sized Ozzy Ozborne poster hanging on the wall! Its beyond strange!  OMG!\n\nI just couldn't get past the really odd decor! I mean, it was so weird that I actually deducted a star because it was so out of sorts.

You can easily rearrange seating for 2 or more. The middle there's a longer high top table for larger parties. There is also seating in the small bar area at back of restaurant.

Thin strips of tender white chicken and napa cabbage,and rice noodles, the vinaigrette used was perfect for me, just slightly sweet and not too tangy and evenly tossed in the salad.

Tiny pretzel sticks with garlic infused chili oil to dip. \n \nPrices are in the moderate range, I didn't see any lunch hour or happy hour specials.\n  \nService A+ - Friendly and efficient.

It was Destinta at one point, and also had another name before that but I can't remember. Anyways, since my last visit, the building has added a trampoline park, which has the same entrance as the movie theater. Today, my husband and I went to see The Revenant. The movies are the movies, so here is my simple breakdown...\n\nPros: \n~All tickets are $6....except on Tuesdays, which is $4. Not bad at all.\n~The seats are comfortable and the theater was clean.\n~If you had little ones attending a birthday party at the trampoline park (like my niece does all the time at this location), you could - hopefully - keep busy with a movie. There are also two rock climbing walls and arcade type games.\n\nCons: \n~Bathrooms were gross. Water all over the counters, garbage on the floor, etc. I opened one stall door and apparently the toilet had a leak. I deduced this in part to 1) my fine detective skills and 2) a large clear plastic bag that was over the entire back of the toilet and went into a garbage can filled to the brim with dirty toilet water next to it. Why not just put an \"out of order\" sign up?\n~Food and drink prices. Obvious, I know. A medium fountain drink is $4,75, which is just ridiculous. Also, apparently, it is now harder to sneak foodstuff in. There is a sign up at the front door prohibiting bringing in any food or drink and the establishment reserves the right to check your bags. Hmmm I guess the staff was slacking today because they missed my bottled water and bag of pretzels.\n\nAll that being said, ticket prices are still cheap.

We were like, \"Huh?\" It wasn't even busy and the bar wasn't closing. She said we'd have to pay for each drink as we went.

You told us five seconds ago. Holy tacky.\n\nBefore we left, another friend with more cojones than yours truly spoke to our server to politely question the automatic 20% gratuity** based on the level (read: low) of service she received. Even after some back and forth, in an amazing demonstration of the very lack of customer service skills being called out, the server refused to reissue the bill. Seriously? Is the auto-tip on groups here a free pass to be awful? Another girl accidentally double-tipped because of this, too.\n\nI'm not sure what the folks at Geraldine found to dislike about making quick money on a chilled-out group downing pricy drinks for maybe an hour.

Seating is in cramped booths unsuitable for people taller than 6', or at the bar. The interior is hideous: bugly, dated paneling, linoleum and illumination by neon promo signs.

Months that felt like years. But the moment I set foot in that door I immediately felt like I was home. My shoulders relaxed. My breathing eased up. I felt like my soul just got a massage. \n\n....a love song which describes my complete amazement upon walking inside on how much of the old you is still there with the new you. Wallpaper? Check. Lounge seats? Check. Wall fixtures? Lamps? Disco ball? Dancefloor? Low lights (and I mean LOW lights)? Cheap tinsel lining the ceiling? Check x 6. So now the bar is on the left instead of the right, but I don't mind. You're obviously still you, and that's all that matters.\n\n...a love song about the fact that the crowd inside tonight was just like the crowd inside the old you every night. Black, white, brown, yellow, green. It didn't matter then what color you were, and it sure as hell doesn't matter now. Everyone is chill. Everyone is relaxed. Everyone is cool. No airs. No pretense. No scene. Even the huge guy wearing the white full-length fur coat with matching white fur hat and white patent leather shoes and bling on every finger. Coolest, chillest guy in the room - just enjoying himself and having a great time and friendly to everyone. \n\n...a love song which exemplifies the glories of the drinks and the service. Drinks? Still dirt cheap. Service? Still completely & genuinely friendly. Never once makes you feel like for some reason you're not cool enough to belong there.\n\n...a love song which shows my great appreciation for the music. The funk and R&B is back, people. \"Let's Stay Together\", your perennial classic, followed by \"You Dropped A Bomb On Me\", followed by \"Word Up\", followed by \"Don't Stop Till You Get Enough,\" followed by....\"Jailhouse Rock?!?\" Yes, it did happen.

For the first time since I've been in Arizona. 2 years, and it came down to being in the new you to compel me to bust out some moves. Now I wouldn't say I have mad skillz with the way I move. Might be reminiscent of the African Anteater Ritual. But who cares? You never did.\n\n...and last but not least...\n\n...a love song about how you actually came back to me. And to everyone else who loved you. How you simply didn't just throw your hands up in the air and call it quits. How you persisted and moved forward. How volunteers toiled day and night moving as much from your old location to the new one to make everyone feel comfortable from the moment they walked in. How you have truly pulled a Phoenix and have risen from the ashes. How I'll admit that driving by the empty lot on 7th Ave and Indian School was a depressing experience, but no more. \n\nBecause you're back.\n\nBecause you're one of my favorite spots.

Help to overcome lactose intolerance; 2. aid digestion of milk protein: 3. help prevent and combat digestive tract infections. Okay...fro-yo had me at \"overcome lactose intolerance...\" that's all I'm going to say about that! They change their menu of flavors...you know, to mix it up a little...keeps you guessing.

With two moving professionals it took 3.5 hours plus thirty minutes' travel time to the new place. I was anticipating that it'd take less than three hours and would cost about $250 but it ended up costing $400 plus tip. I still haven't figured out the math but that seems like a lot more than I was quoted. Whatever - at least I didn't have to lift a box, right?\n\nThe movers were almost half an hour late but luckily I wasn't in a rush to get out of my current place or into my new one. The two guys, Nathan and Jordan, were very friendly and professional and had done many, many moves before this one. \n\nI'm pretty sure part of the reason the move took so long was because they wrapped so much of stuff in blankets and bubble - a lot of it unnecessarily. The instructions that I gave were basic - nothing was really fragile and certainly nothing was antique or vintage. Just throw it in the truck and let's go. At one point I saw one of the guys wrapping my shitty 1980s 19\" TV as if it was a rare Faberge Egg - this is the same TV that I couldn't shake on Craigslist for $20.\n\nThey didn't bring the standing wardrobes as advertised and also requested - because of this I had to wrap my hanging clothes in garbage bags at the last minute and most of them barely it into my new closet intact - everything kept falling off the hangers and onto the floor. Needless to say this was a huge nuisance. I was most looking forward to seeing this marvel of moving.\n\nThe movers aren't insured to bring you to your new apartment as a passenger in their truck, so if like most people in the city you don't have access to a car, be prepared to take a cab or beg a friend (my method) to drive you to your new apartment. I didn't know about this rule so luckily a friend was able to pull through at the last minute. If the moving company beats you there they won't get started till you arrive so it's worth it to leave a little earlier than they do. \n\nNothing was broken or damaged and I was overall happy with the move - just wish it had taken less time and not been so pricey. Be prepared to spend more than you had anticipated and you'll be OK. \n\nAlso, try to have water or some other beverage handy for the movers - they were sweating up a storm and it was 30C outside (and probably in my apartment as I'd already turned off the A/C), and I had packed all my glasses and had nothing to drink.
