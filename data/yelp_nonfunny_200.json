My boyfriend and I went along with my parents (who love mid century modern furniture) just to look as I am moving soon and can't buy any furniture until I relocate, but this shop made me want to move to downtown Phoenix and fill my house with everything in this shop. My thrift-genius parents taught me to buy antique furniture and never ever ever buy new, as new furniture is expensive to buy and cheaply made. Modern on Melrose is fantastic proof of this - my boyfriend fell in love with a yellow leather and wood 70s couch and noticed that this beautiful couch cost less than a couch our friend recently bought at IKEA. And no one is going to buy IKEA couches in antique stores 40 years from now, because they barely last 1 move. \n\nEverything in this store is gorgeous and there is a great variety of furniture and random decor goods. We ended up buying some great stacking canisters as a gift, and the very helpful employee dashed back to the area we got them and told us they were 40% off. We debated keeping the canisters because they were as affordable as they were quirky and useful and interestingly designed, but the Christmas spirit prevailed and we decided to give them to their original recipient.\n\nThe same employee discussed style and furniture things with my father in a very helpful and absolutely non pretentious way, which is a refreshing and fun element of any antique store. I always want to talk to the employees but very often feel they are too busy or want to sound smarter than me (which they are, but I'm not buying anything if the person I'm giving money to makes me feel stupid).

Typically, Indian restaurants dry the crap out of their chicken when they put it in the tandoor, and this is the strongest point in favour of this restaurant getting 4 stars.\n\nThe ambiance is where it looses a bit of cache for me.

I liked the paintings of Nepal on the walls as well as the post cards near the door. They've clearly put in effort to make the place not look as tacky as the proverbial south asian restaurant, and for that I commend them. \n\nThe food is not bad per se, but it's pretty generic and forgettable. The Nepali portion of the menu is limited, and unfortunately the differences between the Indian and Nepali dishes were very minimal, for eg,: our server told us that the only difference between Bhuteko Cauli (Nepali Entree) and Aloo Ghobi (Indian Entree) was that the latter had potatoes in it! I understand that Nepali dishes aren't that different but to make the dishes taste the same is a bit ridiculous. They think that since no single table is going to order both the Nepali and Indian equivalents together, they can get away with making cosmetic changes to their dishes.\n\nWe ordered  Keema Samosas,  and the Nepalese Entrees: Aloo Tama Bodi (potatoes, lentils and bamboo shoots) and Khasi Ko Masu (goat meat with bone) and Ras Malai for dessert. The food was freshly prepared and piping hot. The Aloo Tama Bodi was quite bland and the Goat Meat curry tasted like generic Indian  goat curry. I was quite interested in the Aloo Tama Bodi primarily for the bamboo shoots and was saddened to see limp, noodl-y shoots in the bowl. Oh well. However, the Ras Malai was very good: delicately sweet, milky and cool.\n\nThe service was good except that they mixed up our order, but that was corrected in a jiffy.\n\nDinner for two came to about $ 52 with tip and tax.
