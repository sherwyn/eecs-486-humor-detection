I didn't even use the toilet facilities so I shan't complain about them, it seems that aspect of this place has been well and truly covered by previous reviews.

The interior was very bright and open, with just a few tables and simple chairs arranged in the shop front. \n\nAnd so I walk up to the counter with a smile and a greeting to whom I assume was the owner, and was welcomed with a scowl. I gazed up to the board above his head displaying clearly what fillings I could have, yet found myself squinting to try and decipher the crude pictures of the types of sandwich available (toasted, non toasted, baguette, wrap etc). Upon enquiring that these strange hieroglyphics represented, I was again greeted with a very rude response from the man behind the counter along with any enquiry from him as to what I was doing there (?!?). At this point, if it hadn't been for my increasingly ravaging hunger, I'd have simply walked out.  \n\nYet persist I did and ordered a sweet chilli chicken toasted sandwich with a dash of mayo. Yet what I received, as I found out later, was a overly chewy sweet chilli chicken cold sandwich with garlic mayo. Not a great combination at all, it tasted foul. Upon attempting to take a seat in his empty cafe, I was informed by a series of grunts that I had not paid to sit in and that I would have to leave. I was in no mood to argue and so leave I did. On the way out the door, I stopped to take note of the opening hours. Upon seeing this, the owner came forth from the counter and ushered me off the premises. \n\nOverall, the experience was one of extremely unfriendly (bordering on hostile) staff and poor quality of food. I hadn't even been offered brown or white bread, and the order was wrong.

I saw a dentist out in a rural area, who told me I had an impacted wisdom tooth, but said he didn't feel comfortable extracting it. After toughing it out for about a week, I couldn't stand it any longer and started calling every oral surgeon in the Charlotte area to see who could take me within 24 hours. Dr. Marashi's office got me in for a consultation the same day, I believe, and scheduled the removal for the next morning. I opted for full sedation, even though it wasn't going to be covered by my insurance, because I just wanted to get it over with in the easiest possible way. \n\nThe day of the visit, everything went great. He and his staff were calm, professional and welcoming. He handled the IV sedation himself, and I didn't feel a thing. One minute, I was lying in the chair in excruciating pain, and the next, I was in the recovery room, and it was all over. He sent me home with detailed instructions, some prescription pain medication, and an antibiotic. I used the pain medication the first night, and then was able to switch to Advil the next day. I had some tenderness in the area, but absolutely no facial swelling or bruising. \n\nSo why not five stars? Because Dr. Marashi was supposed to call and check on me that night, and he didn't. He also didn't return my call when I left him a message about a concern I was having (which turned out to be nothing). Is that a huge deal? No, but it made me feel like I received a lower standard of postoperative care because I was a one-time patient from out of town. \n\nAnother reason for the four star review: when I got back to Chicago, I started experiencing pain around the area where the wisdom tooth had been removed.  I assumed it was a dry socket issue, but my dentist discovered that I had an infection and significant bone loss in the molar adjacent to the site of the wisdom tooth removal. He thought it was possible that the pain I had been experiencing in North Carolina had been caused by these issues, and not by the wisdom tooth. After battling several infections in the molar, and months of pain, I ultimately had to have that tooth removed, as well. Maybe Dr. Marashi was aware of these issues, but he didn't think they needed to be addressed right away. Or maybe he didn't notice it at all.  To be fair, I told him that I had an impacted wisdom tooth when I came in for the consultation, so he was probably just focused on that. \n\nThose frustrations aside, I would go back to his office in a heartbeat if I ever needed oral surgery in the Charlotte area again. Dr. Marashi has a very calm and professional demeanor, which means a lot when you're in pain and you just want someone to take care of you. His staff was also very kind and comforting.

He takes the time to explain to you what is going to happen and how it is going to happen. There are no surprises. You are well prepared by the time you get in the chair. \n2) I chose the sedation because I was a wimp and very scared. It worked great. I have a medical condition, so I could not be sedated 100%, but to be honest it didn't matter. I felt fine and comfortable. \n3) Dr. Marashi is very personable. When I got in the chair he talked to me about movies and what I did today. Honestly, we were chopping it up like we were old homies. \n4) He is on time. \n5) He checked in on me on the evenings after I had surgery. He personally called me to make sure that I was feeling okay. Now that is first class service. \n6) He is cute too! \n7) No pain! I did not have any pain whatsoever after my wisdom teeth extractions! I even went out to eat at the Olive Garden and had a full meal afterwards (and 2 of my teeth had to be cut out)! \n\nCons:\n\n1) He doesn't take insurance, so you do have to pay for the surgery! But who really deals with insurance anymore??? It's worth it to pay for his services.\n\nBottom line: I can't recommend this guy enough.

My excitement sky-rocketed when I noticed this little place opened up so close to home and finally came to check it out a couple weeks ago.  The owner of Le Canard Mort closed down the former Le Resignol and opened this new little taco bar.  I have never been to the other restaurants, but Le Canard Mort has definitely been on my radar, and I cross my finger it will be much better than this.\n\nThere were two of us when we came and thought it was closed because it was so dark and empty.  It could have just been because it was late afternoon during down time, but I've never seen more than 2 people in here at a time anyway.\n\nWe were casually greeted, and we picked up a menu off the table.  It consists of enchiladas ($13-$16), burritos ($9-$12), nachos, and a few salads.  The tacos range from $4.50 to $9 each, or you can choose to get the platter of 2 which includes rice and salad.  And so for a quick lunch:\n\nBlackened Catfish Taco Platter: $14 (2/5 stars)\nThe fish itself was cooked and seasoned well.  However, it was not hot... warm at best.  The yellow mole lacked flavour, and the mango salsa was... meh (I can make way better!).  Overall, a bit dry and lacking in flavour... and heat.  Very disappointed with the \"platter\" aspect since it was a tiny scoop of bland rice with what seemed like canned black beans heated in a microwave and poured on top.  The salad was several lettuce leaves with... I forgot what else (not worth the mention anyway).\n\nShrimp Taco Platter: $14 (1.5/stars)\nShrimp was cooked well, but definitely lacked flavour, chipotle mole was inexistent according to my taste buds.  The tomatillo salsa was alright, but missing the bold taste tomatillo salsas promise to deliver.  Again, a bit dry and I wished I hadn't gotten the platter... double disappointment.\n\nService: (2/5 stars)\n2.5 stars.  The server was nice, but there was really nothing that was done to put her above the McDonald's counter service.  We originally asked to get the food to go, but decided to stay after we got the food.  She brought some utensils, napkins, and bottled sauces, then she reached into our bag and took the packaged sauces back so we wouldn't waste it.  I mean, I hate to waste and would have probably given it back anyway... but SERIOUSLY?!\n\nI am a forgiving person and I believe (almost) everyone deserves a second chance.  Chef's and restaurants have their bad days too, so yes, I will go back ONE DAY to get ONE taco and hope that it will make up for EVERYTHING.

Too much cilantro and lime and it was chunky. It wasn't mushed. I know avocado costs less than $1 Make it worth my while and mush, mush I say! \n\nBut the surprise was the nachos. The corn chips were really tasty (I like my salt!) and with the mix of ingredients they had on top of the chicken, was quite good.

If you want to try some great Mexican food at a really inexpensive price...try it out!", "business_id": "IJrRJLKS7qxzzVUkh1U5iA", "stars": 5, "date": "2009-07-05", "useful": 2, "type": "review", "cool": 1}, {"funny": 0, "user_id": "3oSWyq3y4BGtJ9xfyyH9og", "review_id": "VbXnpVjnIUGvaaSgLFugZg", "text": "The food here is wonderful.

Loved their tandoori chicken, butter chicken, lamb vindaloo, and curry goat!  The naan is great too!  The owner stopped by our table to make sure that everything was to our satisfaction (very friendly and pleasant) and our server was very friendly and attentive.  It's better Indian food than a lot of the other Indian places around here, in Richmond Hill, and a much better value too (you get a lot for your money and it's much cheaper than the competition).

We tried the buffet and everyone pretty much enjoyed all the food - especially the $10+tax price tag. There isn't as much selection in the buffet here compared to some others in the area, but given the price that's kind of expected. All the tables are for groups of 4 so for bigger groups you'll have to split up or re-org the tables (and at max you can still only seem to combine 2 tables). The Naan was tasty, there's an even split of veggie and non-veggie options (like 4 of each), with a couple of sweet dishes. I'd like to give this place a 4.5 - I don't think it quite meets the \"5 star\" standard (in particular for me, it was missing both my favorite veggie dishes - malai kofta and shahi paneer) but its still really good.\n\nThe place is also very clean, according to one of the tips below they just recently renovated and renamed to \"Punjab Kitchen & Bar\" in case your favorite navigation app (or calling in and hearing the wrong name) confuses you.", "business_id": "1eomYFLhoxC-y2PGnnNtlg", "stars": 4, "date": "2015-10-13", "useful": 0, "type": "review", "cool": 0}, {"funny": 0, "user_id": "TH704PDluPOIL1CLRava7A", "review_id": "vaIUmMG68OATnTBL3RvkQw", "text": "This is my fourth visit!

But at 9.99 for lunch buffet, it was certainly worth a try. Going in on the second Monday of June, I was completely satisfied with my meal. \n\nThe decor is clean, modern, yet comfortable. There are white table cloths on the table and the silverware is sparkling. The service was also very attentive and kind. Every time my glass was less than full, it was topped up promptly. The waitress had a smile on he face and genuinely seemed like she enjoyed serving us.\n\nThe selection is a touch smaller than India's Taste, but each item is done very well.  It is certainly now in the top three India buffets I have been in Toronto, and I have been to most all of them. \n\nFirstly, there is your typical salad selections, with a spread of various India pickles, chutneys, dips, and raita. Along with good steamed basmati rice, and papadums, these formed the basics in which most other buffets are the same.\n\nThe butter chicken is made with care, and very fragrant, not too spicy and has the aroma of cream and butter.  Absolutely divine.\n\nGoat curry was extremely tender. Did not fight with it at all. Even my toothless grandmother could chew it with ease.  The flavour was warm, inviting, and satisfying.  A good pair with rice and naan.\n\nThere were three different veggie curry selections this day: eggplant, okra, and mixed veggies. All three were unique and flavourful.  I especially liked the mixed veggies.  Seeing as this is a Nepalese and India restaurant (the owners are obviously Nepalese) the spicing is done a little differently than I am used to, but I am enjoying it a lot more.\n\nSamosa are probably the best I have had in Toronto.  Beats out all others I have had.  The pastry is just thick enough, crisp on the outside yet tender. The filling is spiced potatoes, but cut into very small cubes, much smaller than usual.  This made the filling creamy feeling, yet toothsome. A pleasant divergence from the typical gummy mash that others serve.\n\nThere is actually chicken biryani on the buffet, and I can attest it is better than most others that say they specialize in biryani. The fried noodles are also very good, utilizing their tandoori chicken as the protein.  It has a slightly smoky flavour in the background; what we Cantonese would call the 'qi of the wok'. I couldn't get enough of it.\n\nThe naan was equally impressive. Soft and tender on the inside, with a crisp and smoky crust. You can tell it was freshly made.  Better yet, it was brush with real ghee/butter! Most place use vegetable ghee (I can tell), but this place had naan with the distinct fragrance that only real ghee can give.  Kudos to them.\n\nAs a plus, they had shrimp on the buffet. Sauteed in butter and spices, they were done very well.  I am slightly allergic to shrimp, but I risked it anyway, to get a few pieces in.\n\nDessert was limited, but included my favourites: gulab jamun and kheer.  There was also fresh fruit (watermelon was in season and very sweet) and mango puree with fruits.\n\nLooking at their take-out menu, they even make momos.  I wish they had those on the buffet. As well, as some of their Nepalese specials.  Would make the experience even better.\n\nA stone's throw away from The Host, this place is definitely the superior competitor.  Come and try for yourself.  I can see myself being a regular at this point.", "business_id": "1eomYFLhoxC-y2PGnnNtlg", "stars": 5, "date": "2015-06-08", "useful": 1, "type": "review", "cool": 0}, {"funny": 0, "user_id": "4yGImSwdU9FZxVQIbZql3w", "review_id": "5Ylv_tgQsg2OwkNRTQ1_LQ", "text": "It's closed!
