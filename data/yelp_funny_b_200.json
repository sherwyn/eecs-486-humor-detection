If you're not careful you could walk right past this place as the tiny re-purposed house has only a tiny sign to let you know it exists.\n\nEntering, I was greeted by a crowd of locals, a room full of oscillating ceiling fans, and an artistic decor that would make an Toronto Hipster weep with joy.

The cappuccino was amazing! The beans were a unique custom, freshly roasted/ground blend, and the latte/foam art on the top was art all by itself. $3.15 for the Cappuccino (taxes in).\n\nEveryone here is incredibly friendly and I certainly recommend you come here if you're looking for great service, good food and a little peace and tranquility in the middle of your day. \n\nCash Only!", "business_id": "5m-WYdtIUgfvZdStqmSiRA", "stars": 4, "date": "2013-01-16", "useful": 4, "type": "review", "cool": 5}, {"funny": 3, "user_id": "ndtF7YJNv02TevAyhrxJlw", "review_id": "UMRrjA_FoIWSPqOSF4bjxw", "text": "Let me first clarify that I am Vietnamese.  All Asians know when they hear a restaurant is good you gotta ask, \" Did a white person tell you that or were they Asian?\"  Come on you know you do it too. And i'm not trying to say that people of the light skin can't appreciate Asian food ( I have a non asian friend who eats lots of asian food I wouldn't eat) , but come on when you've been eating it almost everyday for your entire life you know a little bit more than someone who's had it a dozen times.\n\nMy review is a little skewed in the fact that I haven't had too many things here.  I've really only had  cha gio bun tit nuong (Spring rolls, and grilled pork with noodles) , ca kho (fish cooked in a clay pot) and canh cua (sour seafood soup).  Let's start with the good.  The cha gio bun tit noung is good.  The cha gio particularly is good, I wish they would give you more they cut up one sorta small one but it's tasty.  I'm sorta jealous that mine cha gio isn't as good, i can't figure out what it is too.  The nuoc mam is pretty good, they julianne carrots in it ( pet peeve when they don't at a restaurant) and they serve it with green onions that are in oil ( hate when restaurants don't do this either).  It's tasty this is what I typically get when I go here.  The other two not so hot, the ca kho was crazy salty, and the canh chua was just blah.  I'm not sure what they are known for at this place, but that's how a lot of Vietnamese restaurants are they make a few things that are great and they specialize in those and just have the other stuff just cause.   \n\nI haven't eaten the Pho cause I am a snob to pho.  I really don't eat Pho anywhere, I really only eat Pho made by my dad (My dad used to have a pho shop)    I will maybe eat Pho in Orange County, NYC, or Toronto.  I'm North Vietnamese we came up with it I know my Pho.   and I'm a purist in that I think Pho should be eaten plain, no hoison no siracha, only a bit of lime.  So sorry no pho review, but it didn't smell bad. \n\nAnd all these reviews about the decor and untidyness.  Well that's just Vietnamese restaurants, and to be perfectly honest I don't think it's too bad even considering it's a Vietnamese joint.   Ha, and I know more than one person who says when choosing between two Asian restaurants in Cali, they go for the one with the lower letter rating.

So, Tempe was the answer until on our way there we noticed this retro looking hamburger joint with a Miller High-life banner hanging in the window.  We decided to skip the drive and go for it, there was even a patio.\nWe walked up and the first thing we saw was a freaky mannequin dressed in a stripper/\"nurse\" outfit placed in the window of the 500 sq ft building.  As soon as we entered the front door, it became clear that the mannequin wasn't the only one sporting this skimpy attire.  The waitresses also had on cheeky skirts, white fishnets, and boobs popping out of their blouses.  This was a sorry attempt as the class of the place left me feeling like I was at some Mesa dive bar, or better yet Band-Aids with burgers.  Creepy men were scattered throughout the tiny place drooling.  Just when I thought it couldn't get any stranger (or funnier!) I spotted the makeshift  bulletin board of the waitresses (all 2 of them) with 50+ pictures of them complete with handwritten captions, and numerous old creepy men like the ones there that afternoon.  It was hard for to believe this place was real, or that someone actually took it seriously!\nWith grumbling bellies and confused looks on our faces we decided to order a couple of PBR's (either PBR or High-life the only 2 choices of brew), and took it to the cement patio.

John Anderson's looks very much like your run of the mill small neighbourhood diners. They serve breakfast, lunch and dinner eats of the diner variety.  It's in a location where this type of food is severely lacked, so they have a niche here.\n\nNow I got a quick homeburger combo with added cheese which cost a very reasonable price of just under $6 after tax (drink not included). The burger does take a while to make so make sure you're not in a hurry like I was. I believe if you can, call and order ahead for pick up cause the wait was about 10-15 mins.\n\nNow once I got back to work to eat my lunch, the burger was literally drenched in grease.  Now I know burgers aren't the healthiest food available, but let's be honest... I wasn't expecting this.  The wax paper that was used was pretty much dripping in grease and the fries... well they're also of the greasy variety.  They are the thick cut fries and weren't really crispy at all (I had some fresh on the way back to work).  So they were deep fried without any REAL purpose as you probably could have baked them and would have turned out the same.  \n\nFirst bite, not bad... but I got a feeling the grease played a huge part.  The patties weren't dry (grease) and they did give me a ton of toppings.  I got the traditional garnish with ketchup and mayo.  The taste was there, but if you can feel worse than McDonalds, here's your winner.  I wasn't thrilled with the fries as I think they were deep fried without any purpose.  They were a soggy and uninspired mess.  The only possible redemption would have been, if it was a poutine, maybe... but c'mon fries not crispy, sorry not feeling it.\n\nSo overall, John Anderson's isn't horrible.  I mean if you're a healthy type I would say stay far away.  If you can feel worse than McD's, here's the place to visit.  I haven't tried their breakfast or dinner, so who knows maybe it's better for those meals.  I think if I am really in need of grease, I would come back.  Cause it wasn't bad in that regard.. the flavour was there and it's very reasonably priced.  But for this level of unhealthiness, I think I rather go to something just as horrible like Popeye's Fried Chicken, but that's my take... what's yours?", "business_id": "UUT3f05dbse6ar-2Ws5GUA", "stars": 2, "date": "2011-08-03", "useful": 4, "type": "review", "cool": 4}, {"funny": 3, "user_id": "CvIEHZF79KLrpNachZzDjA", "review_id": "5ZMpN6wd9TmyBlAj5ILynA", "text": "GROSS.

Nothing too much more that I could ask for. The location of the hotel was a little isolated though. We happened to be out there on business dealing with Rangers Spring Training Baseball. Like most suburbs, you'll need a car to get to where you're going...even though it is located close to a couple of eating spots in case you get hungry.\n\nSurprise is a rapidly growing town, and the newer hotels have probably surpassed this one in popularity...but I'm here to tell you that if most of the town is booked up, and you see this Quality Inn as one of your options, go for it!", "business_id": "3zPeoY0HwIEW-HlX4iXRlQ", "stars": 3, "date": "2015-03-28", "useful": 5, "type": "review", "cool": 3}, {"funny": 4, "user_id": "iSC96O2NjQc3JExGUHQG0Q", "review_id": "-a4mqwxVXtUgRCRdMcKPXQ", "text": "I came here after CMYE with my roommate Roy E too keep the party going and the drinks flowing.

Not that it was all bad the things that did stand out for me was like outside of the building with the art work and like the well lit sign that can see from the road. It located in industry area one that only business other then strip club down the road open at night. So make sure look for the sign or else drive right by it. I like all the widescreen televisions that inside the bar couple of them nice size and perfect chill watch sports (last night case primetime Olympic coverage) drink beers talk stories with friends. They have separate room that has a pool table and dart board. Not sure if they do the world beer stamp card from the show. I like the chalkboard world map on the wall. The bartender she was friendly, on it came too our beers ask us before close too empty, and she has this positive upbeat energy vibe. Really in the end Hammer & Ales still dive bar for me. As for Dive bars nothing that really stood out for me thankfully bartender and hanging out with roommate made the most of first time visit. I know they serve food but after the food coma was in from CMYE last thing on my mind so never asked the bartender for the menu, She never asked us if wanted one. They do have nice selection of beers on tap too choose from although last night felt like looking at the taps few that was out.  \n\nThe area is not exactly the most safe area and coming out of the bar feel like looking over my shoulder something bad going too happen.

BUT I've been very happy with the promptness of delivery (and it comes in a lovely white Philosophy box) and the delicious scents (I love stepping out of the shower smelling like a cinnamon bun!).\n\nI also think they have a great business model set up. They regularly offer codes for free lipglosses and 4 oz bottles of three-in-ones, an excellent way to let customers try a product without purchasing it. They also let you choose samples at checkout. I might start buying their skincare items, too.\n\nSo, Philosophy, I'm definitely a repeat customer.

Past experiences have been pleasant- friendly and helpful staff, and the wine is good. We actually had two of their brands at our wedding reception. Believe me, I'm no connoisseur, I just know what I think tastes good. Anyway...\n\nTwo weekends ago, my friend and fellow yelper Carrie and I attended a murder mystery dinner at the newest Greenhouse Winery location on Pinewood Road. This was our first visit to this new location but certainly not our first murder mystery dinner, which we both love. (The husbands were left home on this occasion.) Our tickets cost $45 each, which included 5 free wine samples, dinner, and the show. This is more than any other show we've been too; most are around $32. The only difference is that they don't include the wine tasting. Since there are several moving parts to this event, I'll break them down for you as best I can:\n\nThe winery: the place is up a long winding road, on top of a hill. It's very nice and in the summer I could see going up there with lunch, playing some bocce or horseshoes and drinking some wine (like rich folk do lol). We were told that they do not make or serve food, but they do have meat and cheese trays you can buy. You are permitted to bring your own food and make a day of it. The day we were there was extremely windy and, being on top of a hill, I could see this being an issue if you planned on being outside. As mentioned, we were permitted 5 free samples of wine, which we of course took full advantage of. Of course, a sample is really like 2 sips, maybe. You could 'buy' additional sips for $1 each or choose to buy wine by the glass or bottle to take into the show with you. So, hey, buy a bottle right...because it's the cheaper option in the long run. They also provided coffee, water, and pop (soda for you non-yinzers).\n\nThe show: Fun and funny as usual. Although both of the winners were at our table and not us. Meh. \n\nThe service: Nearly non-existent. At other locations, they have wait staff coming around to check on your table, take away plates, fill up water, etc. Not here, they had someone come around twice - once to take appetizer plates and once for dinner plates. I had to go back out into the winery area to ask for more water and I was told to please bring my carafe and they would fill it up. Umm, no. Anyway, the real issue laid with the drunks at the table behind us. They were talking loudly, laughing, and just all around being jerks. Everyone on our side of the room was visibly annoyed. One of the guys at our table turned around ask them to quiet down, and the one jerk actually told him \"I will f-n kill you.\" It was terrible. And hey, I'm all for rowdiness...if it suits. This just wasn't the place for some ball-bustin, whiskey shooting, hell of a time. Feel me? They clan of 5 were finally either kicked out or asked to leave, but honestly it was half way through and already such a distraction at that point. I feel that if there were staff around more, they would have gotten kicked out a lot sooner and not cut into my $45 dinner.\n\nSpeaking of dinner. The food: the worst I've had at a murder mystery dinner. They buffet style dinner consisted of breaded chicken (which I like but Carrie didn't have so much luck with), stuffed shells (passed on those), potatoes and tortellini salad. The food was fine, there simply wasn't much selection. I can't really give the winery too much slack for this because it was catered. However, they still should have done their homework on what other locations provide. My biggest grip with this was we've paid $32 at The Lamplighter and they have chicken, fish, roast beef, ham, cole slaw, salad, fresh veggies, etc. So, we really both felt ripped off.\n\nTo sum it up, I would come back in the summer to hang out and have lunch.

It's small, quiet (on most days), and green. I go there when I don't want to deal with crowded parks like Sunset. Actually, I have mostly given up on Sunset and replaced it with Paradise. :) \n\nThe way these people make Paradise out to be is totally not what it really is. I say, check it out for yourself. If you prefer grass and matured trees over the dull gravely desert landscapes found in these newer 'homeless free' parks, or you just want to get away from crowded parks, but still want to enjoy the greenery, then Paradise is the place to go. I have had a lot of peaceful picnics here. Never had a problem with homeless people (who I've barely scene) or drug dealers (who I've NEVER seen, and I've hung out here late at night to have some wine with friends.).

But, hey, guess what?  It works, and there's always something going on.  \n\nThere's plenty of benches and, since we're not prissy and use park grills, plenty of grills to use.  There's a covered area or two that, on the weekends, are usually reserved for parties, but you could call Parks and Rec to reserve them for yourself if you were so inclined.  The park boasts a large playground, exercise route, basketball courts, a rec center and a pool.  It's an older park, and the trees are mature, full and offer plenty of shade in the summer.  Ice cream trucks used to have little ice cream wars trying to get customers to buy their (identical) wares over their competitors (identical) confections and hopefully will once it warms up again.\n\nOf course, Tropicana and McLeod is no longer exactly the BEST neighborhood in town.  The park police patrol the park regularly, oftentimes not bothering to get out of the car but driving through the park on the grass itself.

I'm still in love.\n\nHave used it on five occasions now, and have had a fantastic experience every time.\n\nThe app is free and available for iOS and Android. And it's AWESOME.\n\nIt finds you on the map (you can edit/adjust as necessary), then tells you how far away the nearest cab is. On every occasion, it was less than five minutes. UNHEARD OF!!! It's always at least 15-20 minutes when I call other Toronto taxi companies (I'm looking at you, Beck and Co-op!) so this has been life-altering!! \n\nSo once you see how long the cab would take to reach you, you decide whether to \"hail\" it or not. If you do, you will then be connected with the driver. The map will continue to show both you (a little blue bonhomme) at your location and the cab (a yellow car icon) moving towards you. It's adorable. The time continues to count down and an alert sound is played when the taxi is one minute away, then again when it has actually arrived.\n\nAnd off you go! Once in the cab, you can choose a tip amount (15%, 20%, 25%, etc. options) and watch your little blue man ride the yellow cab on the map all the way to your destination. ADORBS!!! Once payment has happened and you're out of the cab, you can rate your driver (5-star scale). A receipt is emailed to you, and the trip is saved in a log within the app. It's all pretty slick, and very impressive. \n\nYou can easily find promo codes for them online - there are $5 and $10 credit codes right now, some only good for your first ride. The most recent driver gave me some business cards to give to my friends with a $5 code on it too - sweet!\n\nIt's been a while since I've been so jazzed about a new business or service, but I love it when someone finds a way to make my life easier. \n\nThis one is going to change the whole industry.

Here it is: Hailo is the only City-licensed app-based taxi service.

My one irk is when people review something on Yelp outwith its context or usefulness. If you don't believe, or use, complimentary and herbal remedy you may well think Napiers is a bit of hoo-hah and pricey to boot.\n\nBut if you do see the value, and have reaped the benefits, of herbal remedies in the past then Napiers is like a mecca for all things herbal and healing. You can generally find herbal remedies in most places now, like Boots and even the supermarkets, and the other big brand Holland&Barret.\n\nNapiers, however, only really stock their own brand products but they're none the worse for it. They have their own blends of things, so when I went in looking for arnica cream to use on an ITB knee injury (for ligament pain) they suggested a Napiers blend with all sorts of other things AND arnica I hadn't heard of anywhere else. And it really, really worked a treat.\n\nThe shop assistants are very well versed and helpful, and really listen and suggest things that might work for your ailment.

See my lists for details.\n\nBar Zo\u00e9 Karaoke Et Cocktails (etc.) is probably one of the best karaoke bars in Montreal. It does a lot of things really well, nothing really badly, and a few things...surprisingly--and comes on top in almost every respect.\n\nSinging:\n\nZo\u00e9's singing setup is the best I've seen anywhere. Singers (up to two live microphones) have a stage to themselves next to the DJ booth, and can easily read the lyrics from two visible screens. The acoustic is set up smartly with sensitive mics, invisible but powerful monitors and good instrumental tracks. The song selection is serviceable and often includes more than one version of popular tunes. If you've picked out a duet by mistake, the DJ will sing with you, even if he doesn't know the lyrics. He's a trooper.\n\nFor the best conditions in town to absolutely destroy a song, I give Zo\u00e9's five Busted Microphones.\n\nBooze:\n\nThis is Zo\u00e9's weakest point, which means it's merely good.\n\nThe selling point of their bar menu is obviously the cocktails, being in the business name and all. They're tasty, generally sweet items for people who prefer their poison colourful. The full list of available mixed drinks is quite exhaustive and you can expect to find something right for you. The beer, on the other hand, is somewhat disappointing, with a limited selection of somewhat overpriced brands on tap. Still, with such a solid offering, your friends will soon find it in themselves to belt out their best Sinatra.\n\nFor a great variety at the expense of decent cheap beer, Zo\u00e9 receives four Bohemian Rhapsodies.\n\nExtras:\n\nThis is where this place really shines. \n\nLet's agree that Karaoke is a gimmick to sell alcohol to groups who normally would not be inclined to close a bar, let even go to one. Zo\u00e9 recognized this and ran with it. They will gimmick the crap out of you.\n\nBefore the Karaoke starts, the bar doubles as a specialized fondue restaurant (!), and demonstrates a staggering dedication to the concept. The white tablecloths, the reusable towelettes, the wine card, the actually pretty great food and all the details I missed; it's like they're secretly ashamed of being a Karaoke bar. This makes for a mighty fine evening.\n\nThere are some other inspired decisions. The songbooks are actually computers with keyboard screwed into the walls; you can look up songs by title or artist name almost immediately, provided you know what you are looking for. Singers have their back to a giant screen where onlookers can easily read the lyrics and sing along. There is a smallish dance floor. The gambling room is entirely isolated from the main bar. The restrooms are way classier than they have any reason to be.\n\nFor outdoing themselves in any conceivable respect, Zo\u00e9 gets five Awesomes out of a possible five.\n\nAs with any Karaoke bar, your night will largely by defined by the people with you. That being said, once you are ready to surprise your coworkers with that one song you sing really well, you'd be hard pressed to find a better stage than Zo\u00e9's. It's relentless assault of genuine coolness on what is essentially a kitschy activity will win the hearts of even the most stuck-up anti-singing drones.

I know, I know -  you are all shocked! Call me old-fashioned, but having had a few bikes stolen in the past myself, I just didnt want to go that route...not that I wasn't tempted. So I headed out to local bike stores, swallowing my fears about the price. My fears about the price were not unfounded. There appear to be two main types of bike stores south of Davenport: those that are well-priced, but don't offer quality, and those that offer quality, but the bikes are almost *certain* to get stolen, because of the ginormous price tags...(I am not including the stores selling the stolen bikes).\n\nSo I ventured further North, and it wasn't long before I fell in love with a hybrid women's Trek - despite the flowered decals!

Being long in the legs, and short at the waist (sniff, sniff) a bike designed for women makes all the difference, hokey decals aside (I used similar arguments for my mtn bike and my downhill skiis, also of the prerequisite flowers and pretty colours, ugh i have no shame). \n\nSo I forked over the extra dough, and almost two years later, I couldn't be happier. Trek may not be hip, or made in the Netherlands, but I heart my bike, and it has been great. The initial service was good (they encourage you to take the bikes for a spin), and I haven't needed to go back since.\n\nAnd once the warranty is over, you can spray paint the flowers away!", "business_id": "CGpC_L37PBnIbs8TsuBEpA", "stars": 3, "date": "2010-01-07", "useful": 2, "type": "review", "cool": 1}, {"funny": 3, "user_id": "X2uF3C3YBD24xcgKA104Sw", "review_id": "czxrezYRddzWJq6stbDvqw", "text": "Now, if this was a review of the food alone, this would have an extra star, but it's not, but I will say - the food was much much better than the naff service here.

Recently Graeter's Ice Cream, a popular Cincinnati ice cream icon opened up in the renovated Caesar's Palace food court. The company boasts that this is the first location West of the Mississippi River. \n\n The Vegas Strip is a grown up Disney Land. When I am in Disney Land I want to get ice cream. Our original intention was to stop at Ghiradelli in the Linq. Unfortunately this location falls far short on sufficient seating. So, my brother recommended Graeter's Ice Cream in Caesar's Palace. \n\n  Graeter's Ice Cream is incorporated in the Caesar's Palace food court next to Starbuck's. Because of its small size, I regard this more of a Graeter's Express than a full scale ice cream parlor. When I researched the company online, Wikipedia showed a sundry of flavors. However, at this food court location I saw ten signature flavors on the overhead menu. They were black raspberry chocolate chip, caramel gelato, chocolate, mint chocolate chip, dark chocolate gelato, mocha chocolate chip, lemon sorbet, double chocolate chip, vanilla bean, and salted caramel. I could write that it is quantity over quality with an argument that Graeter's specializes in a French pot method of ice cream making that is supposedly so good that they process it two gallons at a time. \n\n Just like Disney Land, prices in many of the businesses throughout the adult Disney Land are ridiculously expensive. For the price of what a couple of scoops cost here, unless your on a diet, it is worth it to go all the way for a sundae. \n\n  I ordered the strawberry shortcake sundae. It was two scoops of black raspberry chocolate chip and mocha chocolate chip ice cream in substitution for vanilla covered with strawberry topping, whipped cream and a cherry served in a paper bowl. The ice cream was delicious. But why don't they offer strawberry ice cream? It is only fitting that a strawberry shortcake sundae would go along good with strawberry or strawberry chip ice cream. Regardless, the sundae was delicious. \n\n  Regarding Graeter's, I  scream that their ice cream is a delicious treat if you are in the center of the Las Vegas Strip.", "business_id": "LgjI2iZlryV0bX5mwSgXEg", "stars": 3, "date": "2015-04-01", "useful": 4, "type": "review", "cool": 5}, {"funny": 6, "user_id": "NwVyki35xOcaxhMzHNtHDQ", "review_id": "faz6NnZaq0x6Y1qpe9_TtQ", "text": "There is something seriously awesome about being on the hunt for a really good pen, then having a lightbulb moment that there actually is a shop in Stockbridge that exists to sell stationary.

The burger which is his own blend of chuck and brisket was done over an open flame grill to a perfect medium rare/medium with a nice char flavor with lettuce, tomatoes, onions and your choice of cheese. Wifey went with the Jalapeno Havarti as suggested by Mr. Jorgenson. We were very pleased with our choices, but would ask for more sauce on the pulled pork and to toast the buns for sandwiches/burgers.\n\nHis business hours vary...He opens at 5 pm, closes between 9 and 10 pm, depending on business, availability of items, and takes two days off a week.\nIf his trailer isn't there, he's off doing a pop-up service at a local business in town.\n\n*The best thing to do before taking the drive out is call to check hours, availability of items and location so you won't be disappointed.

The menu is pretty lean for breakfast; muffin, bagel, or something like a muffin or something like a bagel.\n\nMy friend and I got bagels and cream cheese. Her with coffee and I with earl grey.  The bagel was not really toasted enough and the cream cheese was 2 prepackaged \"PHILADELPHIA\" pouches dropped on my plate.  Jen said the coffee was ok and I suppose I could say the same about my earl grey--simply a tea bag in a mug of hot water.\n\nDespite the subparness of the eats and drinks, there are a few things that are really positive about The Willow House.  Such as:\n\n+++Free Wi-Fi+++\nNot only free, but blazing fast Wi-Fi and no silly password or time limits.\n\n+++Vinyl Digging+++\nTheir is a coat closet filled with 12\" albums covering a good range of musics and qualities POOR to VERY GOOD and maybe some NEAR MINT if you really dig. The price was reasonable too with $1 per one or $6 for an entire crate (50+ LPs)!!!\n\n+++Local Resource+++\nThe local rag is there as well as flyers for DIY shows and even a Crispin Glover speaking event.  This is pretty ordinary, but still always commendable when these types of resources are getting fewer and fewer with big box infiltration.  Not every biz allows free advertising space for DIY artists and musicians.\n\n+++Outdoors***\nRed picnic tables are scattered around in the side lawn of The Willow.  True that in Phoenix, comfortable outside dining time is limited. Near these tables there is also this wall comprised of beautiful metal panels all colorfully weathered, rusted, and corroded.  Perhaps I am biased with my unorthodox rust-belt view of what true beauty is.--But I find it so and i write so and so it is.\n\n***Cats***\nI am a gigantic catfag in every way.  Outside, next to the picnic tables there was a concrete garden bench and under this bench was. EEEEEKKKK!!!  A mussy mess of black and white cat keeping her cool.  She was a very skanky looking cat and I was smitten.  I instantly made her a little song as I sung to her and took photos . I think, \"Dusty Desert Skanky Cat\" was part of the lyrics and it was a tad Pete Seger sounding.  I later learned that that was a momma cat that the employees of The Willow House named Thundercat and there are other cats that climb a tree to bathe in the morning.

I emailed them for a quote and had a well-written, detailed response in my inbox just an hour or so later. \n2. They confirmed with me the day before and morning of my first scheduled service. Life gets hectic and there's nothing better than a reminder (or two) of an upcoming appointment. \n3. They arrived promptly without calling fifty times for directions. We've hired service providers who have called asking for step-by-step instructions for arriving at our home. That's what Google Maps is for. \n4. They asked for clarification. As any teacher, parent or boss would say, it's better to ask and do something right than to not ask and do it wrong. \n5. They got the job done and did it well. In just four hours (keep in mind we have a fairly large house that hasn't been cleaned in, say, 9 weeks), our house sparkled from top and bottom.

It dosn't matter if it's over the phone or in person.  And everyone gives you a different story!\nSo check this out.  We have several accounts.  I have one, hubby has one and we have a joint account. So I closed my account.  They want to start charging $10.00 per mo.  Sorry, I'm not going to pay that.  That's $120.00 per yr.  So I closed it.  Ok, so now I don't have access to this closed account anymore right?   So a few days later, I go to the joint account to pay a bill and to transfer money from the joint account to another bank.  So I didn't see anything pending in the other bank.  hummmm, so I call.  They can't tell me anything, I call the other bank, they say it's not on there in, and give it another day.   Now I'm getting pissed.  So I call Armed forces bank.  Ohhhh some how they took money out of the closed account,  huh?  How the heck did that happen, and I don't have access to that account.  Well bill pay, did it.  Ok, I need $ transferred to that bank, and you guys need to get that $ out of the account it was transferred to.   They said oh after a certain amount of time they system will catch it.  We will do a free transfer to your other account.  You should have it in a few hours.  Ok cool.  So anyway to make the story short.  I was on the phone with them all week.  No one knew anything, no one can see that I had double the $ that was transferred to that account.  I was so annoyed.  Finally, I got a phone call from the bill pay.  I told them I had been on the phone with AFB all week, and they couldn't tell me to call bill pay (your company)  Also come to find out from the bill pay guy.  That on the AFB if you have more than 1 account you have to go in and delete that account!  Ok, I don't freaking work for the bank.

He occasionally makes some of his famous popcorn which is from a real movie theater style popper.  He has nice size tv's in each corner and will always have the game on.  I personally made him a hockey fan during the playoffs.\n\nIf you are tempted, stop in, go for some wings and try a pasta dinner or one of his sandwiches.

On this occasion Kiehl's had sent a reminder the day before to go pick up the lip balm. Now, I like lip balm, of course I do, I'm a girl and I love free and I love Kiehl's, so off I went.

If I were you, I'd be wary of even walking through that front door, because once you claim one of their products as your own, you'll never settle for anything else. And with only one Kiehl's (as far as I know) in all of Toronto, it's a dangerous addiction to have. \n\nSome evidence...\n\nThe \"Supremely Gentle Eye Makeup Remover\" is the only makeup remover that will ever touch my eyes. It's a lotion-based makeup remover, unless some of the grotesque oil-based removers out there that leave your face greasy and necessitate tugging. It's smooth, easy on your delicate eye area and doesn't smell weird. I wear dramatic eye makeup most days and this gets all of it off in a snap.\n\nMore evidence...\n\nThe \"Creme de Corps Soy Milk & Honey Body Polish\" is the only scrub I'll ever use. Once you use this scrub, any other exfoliating scrub will seem too gritty, dry or wimpy for your calluses. This is the real deal - it gives you an unbeatable scrubdown and it smells like honey. Oh, and it has jojoba oil in it, which is essential what the sub-species of Humans  With The Softest Skin On Earth\u2122 swear by. I've tried other scrubs from Aveda, Philosophy, etc. and I always come back to this one because it just gets the job done, pure and simple.\n\nOK fine - a third piece of evidence...\n\nAre you using eye cream yet? And if not, why not? You know you should be, if only to start preventing those pesky signs of aging. The \"Creamy Eye Treatment with Avocado\" has a really unique texture and a small container of it, while a little pricey, will last you forever because it goes on really thick. The only thing that could make it better would be SPF 30. \n\nWhen you visit, make sure Zach's working. You'll be able to spot him because he'll be jamming to Lady Gaga, Britney Spears or Kylie, and he'll rush up to you and say \"Oh my god - have you TRIED the new [fancy, convoluted product name that of course you didn't know about but are like, so ready to try like this very instant] yet??\" You'd think Zach was a descendant of the original founders of Kiehl's back in the 19th century; he just knows everything about Kiehl's and its products to a terrifying degree. \n\nThe store sometimes has special makeover nights and product launches, so get on their mailing list so that you'll get invited to them. Another win about Kiehl's is that they're very generous with their product samples, and some of them are good enough to last you months of sampling. It's nice to be able to try stuff before you buy, especially since they have a pretty massive arsenal of products to offer.", "business_id": "2LwD2kptBJxGrIO7zm9EMQ", "stars": 5, "date": "2009-07-06", "useful": 11, "type": "review", "cool": 7}, {"funny": 7, "user_id": "zo2vscKNvDzXWj7YOrdJVA", "review_id": "zYWzxZJ-ohjdk60-NijeIQ", "text": "I can see what all the fuss is about!\n\nGreat spot for brunch.

I don't think I have ever pulled over so quickly.  \n\nWe had heard rumours of this additional location, but we weren't sure when it was opening.  It turned out that it was only their second day in operation.  The interior was not as homey as the original Mitzi's, with their collection of vintage kitchen tables, but the same prints by a local artist hung on the walls.  The entire layout was more hip, more minimalist, more \"College St.\", with a definite touched-by-an-interior designer feel.\n\nThe menu was brought to us printed out on white paper.  We were used to peering up at the blackboard at Mitzi's for the day's menu, as it changes all the time.  I'm not yet sure if this new Mitzi's will follow the same system, but I can't imagine they wouldn't.  Half the fun is anticipating what amazing combinations and flavours will be available for brunch next weekend.\n\nI ordered the oatmeal buttermilk pancake, with fresh cream, blueberries, pernod custard, and the usual spiced potatoes and garnish fruit.  I would never order pancakes normally, but I decided to be adventurous.  I don't generally enjoy pancakes, and I find them heavy and bland, but the aforementioned description of the dish sounded too good to pass up.  I am so glad I didn't.\n\nI have never enjoyed a meal at Mitzi's more than I did that day.  I always ordered French Toast, or Poached Eggs, or something with lentils and Indian spices, and while they were rave-worthy dishes in the past, they were now put to shame by the oatmeal pancake.  It was so moist, light, and delicious, it barely needed the cream or custard.  That being said, the Pernod custard complimented the fresh blueberries so unbelievably well.  Every bite was perfect!\n\nThe wait-staff was incredibly polite and friendly, and we still received our coffee in eclectic mismatched mugs.  I loved all the flower boxes surrounding the patio.

I was disappointed to see that the Nachos were Chips, Cheese Whiz, Tomatoes, Onions on a plate with a small bowl of Beans, cup of Guacamole, cup of Salsa, and two packages of Sour Cream on the side......what the ___?  Was I suppose to create this thing myself?  Where did it say that on the menu?  I know why they did it.....to save money.  There's less food waste when you do stuff like that, but seriously?\n\nAs a fan of Nachos it was a huge letdown.....plus they didn't taste good at all.  The Chips weren't fresh and the flavors were just strange.....unappealing.\n\nMom enjoyed her Fish & Chips, which were really Fish & Fries.  She liked her Fish and I tried a few Fries...they weren't bad.  Maybe I ordered the wrong item?\n\nOverall, the service was good and since Mom enjoyed her dish I'm giving this place 2 Stars instead of 1.\n\nWill I return?

USW is biggest David we have in the battle against the Goliath of Greed that is Corporate America. \n\nThe USW was founded in the blood of those who toil, those whose fingernails have soot under them, those 146 garment workers who died in the Triangle Shirtwaist Factory Fire of 1911, those whose muscles ache at the end of their day, those who make society function, those who produce, those who forge, smelt, lift, climb, rescue, and nurse the injured and sick back to health. \n\nUnions are imperfect, but without them there would be no rights for those who work, and the few in power who scheme, gamble, downsize, and profit would be unstoppable in their economic campaign of terror.

But numerous polls, from those sponsored by the New York Times to USA Today/Gallup, have shown that these Republicans are wrong, that the public is not with them. Consistently, 60 percent in the polls say they oppose legislation terminating worker rights.\"\n\nThey don't want corporations and they don't want governments to return to the days of the Triangle Shirtwaist Factory, when young women, without a union and without an effective collective voice, labored in a fire trap that eventually killed them. They don't want government to give itself or corporations the unfettered ability to exploit workers again.\"\n\n\"No matter how better educated American workers get. No matter how much more innovative. No matter how much more productive. No matter how many tax dollars the government spends on research and development, if the corporations that benefit move manufacturing overseas, the American workers who paid for it will suffer.\"\n\n\"An ordinary American dreams of a family-supporting job, owning a home, saving enough to pay for a child's college education, helping to build a safe community.

Since we don't spend a ton of time in a hotel room in general, we were happy with our latest choice. Typically, we stay at the nearby Courtyard, but because it was all booked up, we decided to try this Hilton Garden Inn instead. I'd say that it is pretty on par with the other HGI that we've stayed at throughout North America.\n\nFor $95 CAD with AAA discount for a Saturday holiday weekend, the price was great. Some other locations were looking at over $120 CAD/night. Access to the hotel is easy right off of Highway 7 and Commerce Valley Drive. There is a lot of construction going on right now, so be prepared to get stuck between the exit off of Highway 404 and Leslie St. if you're arriving around late afternoon-dinner time. As an alternative, you can head west and turn right down Warden and take the back street to bypass it.\n\nThe parking is plentiful and free, and so is the wifi. You can also have wired access if you prefer to be sitting at a desk. Our room was the basic King Room, and it was very large and spacious (around 375 sq. ft. maybe more). The decor is a bit dated with an ornate headboard in a maple wood, and similar nightstands and armoire. The 32\" flat-screen TV was decent, and nice that it didn't have a delayed response. The window coverings were a floral forest green/ivory color combination; again reflecting an older style.\n\nHowever, the bed was surprisingly comfortable. We had stayed at another HGI in New Jersey, and don't recall the bed being this comfortable. It was slightly firm but mostly soft, but most importantly, when one person moved, the other didn't feel it. Yay for no wiggle! :) You sure won't have any slumber issues because of that! The added convenience of a mini fridge, microwave, coffee maker was nice and they were all clean. Washroom was a good size for 2 people, but the door when opened blocked the entryway and there's no fan. Water pressure was great, though the water was evidently hard, thus making for dry skin.\n\nHousekeeping was a little scatterbrained as we had to tell 3-4 ladies that we did not need housekeeping as we were checking out. Each time we told a different lady, they would go back to each other and start bickering. However, each were sweet in personality. The front desk crew could use a little bit more pep in their step but they were pleasant. Breakfast is not included, and is a la carte starting at $8, and buffet is $16 CAD. With all the nearby eating choices, you're better off eating out.\n\nOverall, we had a pleasant stay, and would gladly return. Good value, easy access off of Highway, and about 20 minutes from Downtown Toronto. If you prefer the quiet, request a 6th floor room that faces the back of the hotel.

That's until they pile even more cheese and pep on top of the pizza right before boxing it up. Looking for a meaning? It means \"bloody well good muthaf**er!.\" That's what the artists were trying to convey. :D \n\n\nSo yeah, this is similar to a Beto's pizza with the unbaked cheese compounding the toppings that are already on it.  \n\nAnother interesting thing about DiCarlo's pizza is that they use provolone instead of mozzarella, and it works exquisitely. The pepperoni is smoked, tender, fresh, and the mushrooms are finely cured. The sauce has a citrusy flavor to me. But that crust...\n\nI could eat that golden, buttery, crispy crust alone, naked. The crust I mean, not me. Well, you know what? I would eat this crust in the nude! It's that good.  The crust was so good, I was thankful for how it extended beyond the pie, again, framing the whole thing and giving me the chance to taste the crust by itself.  \n\nBtw, that cheese was melted perfectly when we got it home, and like a Beto's, you can always pop it in the oven if the unmelted cheese is just too far out for ya. I kind of dig it as is though. \n\nTake Beto's pizza and mash it up with DeMino's in Brookline, and you'll have a DiCarlo's pizza.

For $5.95, this creation easily put any $5 footlong to shame. Every individual ingredient was fresh and of excellent quality. Sandwich breads are baked by Bon Breads. The mushrooms appeared shiitake-less in favor of small pieces of chanterelles and other exotic varieties. Large chunks of avocado were incredibly buttery! I even detected a few large grains of sea salt used as seasoning. A small side of homemade pickles seemed to disappear from my plate while I was distracted by the second half of my sandwich.\n\nTaste is a large space with many tables. The layout, with its colorful, mismatched chairs and staircase in the center of the room, reminds me of Michelle Bernstein's trendy cafe Crumb on Parchment, located in Miami's Design District. Baked goods include croissants (served with homemade pear or tomato jam), coffee cake, and mini fruit pies. I didn't confirm where the pastries are brought in from, but square scones always seem like a Chocolate & Spice signature to me. The market area offers some unique coffees, gourmet condiments, and various items, but doesn't really capture my attention. Beer (PBR) and wine are served on tap, and bottled beers are available in a refrigerated case.

Also, I want to add one thing about the prior reviewer stating that the refreshments at this theatre are cheaper; it's simply not true. Even if there is a certain item that is cheaper, the small sizes of everything they sell are a complete rip off. \n\nYeah, so anyways; Let's start off with the militant old woman that runs this hole of a place. Her friendliness reeks disingenuous as she greets you, and then gets on her walkie-talkie to radio the undercover creeps at this theatre watching your every move. She states to them how many tickets were purchased and for what film. Yes, I feel justified calling these people creeps, because that is exactly what they are, creepy. You are treated like a criminal upon entering this theatre, or maybe they just profile people like me, that look different. Either way, there is no excuse for this place. \n\nSo on to the concession stand were we paid $4 for a pretzel with cheese. Thank God there was cheese because this nasty, huge, tasteless piece of microwaved dough in plastic, tasted horrible. We also bought a medium Pepsi and a small popcorn which all totaled about $11. The amount of soda was that of a can and the popcorn had some weird generic taste to it. The girl working the stand also came off as disingenuous. I just can't stand fake smiles. \n\nSo here is the kicker of it all; I go back out to the concession stand before the movie and ask for a courtesy cup. They charge me 25 cents on top of what we already paid! That's not the kicker though. Are you ready for this? She has the AUDACITY to ask me what the cup was for...? Are you splitting popcorn or your pop? Uhhh? Are you serious! She's lucky I was in a good mood, that's all I can say. I should of ripped her head off verbally. This place has no right to ask such things. None what so ever! Let's move on.\n\nThe theatres are actually very small and that of the 90's. If you sit behind someone then you won't be able to see. There is also a very odd, mild scent of dirty toilets that lingers through the theatres.

What I thought was really hilarious, was the amount of people who had snuck stuff in. You heard all kinds of pop cans and bags opening exactly as the previews started. So it looks as if all their Barney Fife tactics fail in the end.\n\nLast but not least, they have plain clothed people standing around hiding their walkie-talkies when the theatres let out, to ensure no one sneaks into another film. They stare at you, as if they are mentally warding you off.\n\nSo needles to say at this point, this theatre is HORRIBLE. I only recommend going if you are dirt broke and want to see a new release. If you're not broke, go somewhere else and spend the extra 2 dollars; Because this place is not worth it.\n\nP.S. What movie theatre has Pepsi over Coke? That's just un-American.\n\nP.S.S.
